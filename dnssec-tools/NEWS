This file contains a list of major changes per release.

0.9.1:
  - validator library (dnssec-tools/validator):
		- code has been re-structured within the following sub-directories: 
		  libsres/ libval/ doc/ etc/ apps/ and include/
		- configures and builds cleanly on the following systems: 
		  Fedora, MacOSX, FreeBSD
		  (should configure and build on Solaris -- not actually tested)   
		- includes support for tuning "off" DNSSEC using the
		  "zone-security-expectation" policy construct. 
		- APIs modified to comply with (upcoming version of) 
		  draft-draft-hayatnagarkar-dnsext-validator-api
 
  - dtinitconf, dtconfchk, dtdefs:
                - these tools are used to create, check and consult the 
                  file dnssec-tools.conf which is used by many of the
                  dnssec tools. dtconfchk was previously known as confchk.
                 
                - modules/defaults.pm was also added to provide defaults
                  for the above tools.

  - rollinit, rollctl, rollchk, rollerd, lsroll:
                - these tools are used to create, check, and list the roll
                  rec files to be used by rollerd and rollctl.

                - rollerd is a daemon to manage DNSSEC key roll-over.

                - rollctl is used to send commands to a rollerd daemon.

  - TrustMan:
                - manages keys used as trust anchors in named.conf and
                  dnsval.conf
                - can be run as a daemon or as a one-time check
                - configuration is placed in dnssec-tools.conf
