details.

1.12								(1/26/12)
 - New Features:

    - libval:       - Made improvements to support IPv6,
                      added the ability to fetch IPv6 glue
                    - Fixed the EDNS0 fallback behavior.
                    - Tidied up the locking semantics in libval. 
                    - Added support for hard-coding validator configuration 
                      information that gets used in the absence of other 
                      configuration data. This feature allows the 
                      validator library to be self-contained in 
                      environments where setting up configuration data at
                      specific locations in the file system is not always 
                      feasible.

    - rollerd:      - Added support for phase-specific commands. This allows
		      the zone operator to customize processing of the rollerd
		      utility during different rollerd phases. 
                    - Added support for zone groups.  This allows a collection
		      of zones to be controlled as a group, rather each of
		      those zones individually.
                    - Improved the manner in which rollerd indexes the zones
		      being managed, with the significantly decreased access
		      times for rollerd's data files.  This results in rollerd
		      being able to support a lot more zones with a single
		      rollerd instance.
                    - rollctl and the rollover GUI programs may have new
		      commands to allow for immediate termination of rollerd.

    - apps          - Added patch to enable local validation in NTP, with
                      the ability to handle a specific chicken and egg problem 
                      related to the interdependency between DNSSEC and an
                      accurate system clock.

                    - Added a patch to enable DNSSEC validation in Qt
                      based applications

    - dnssec-check  - Completely rewritten GUI with many new features
                    - Now contains the ability to submit the results
                      to a central DNSSEC-Tools repository.  The
                      results will be analyzed and published on a
                      regular basis.  Please help us get started by
                      running dnssec-check on your networks!  Note
                      that it explains that it only sends hashed IP
                      addresses to our servers and the reports
                      generated will be aggregation summaries of the
                      data collected.

1.11								(9/30/11)
 - New Features:

    - libval:       - Significant improvements and bug fixes to the 
                      asynchronous support.
                    - Added asynchronous version of val_getaddr_info.
                    - Some reworking of the asynchronous API and callbacks.
                      Note the asynchronous api is still under development and
                      subject to changes that break backwards compatibility.

    - rollerd:      - Added an experimental time-based method for queuing
                      rollover operations.  This original method (full list
                      of all zones) is the default queuing method, but the
                      new method can be used by editing the rollerd script.
                      rollctl and rollrec.pm were also modified to support
                      this change.
                    - Added support for merging a set of rollrec files.
                      rollctl and rollrec.pm were also modified to support
                      this change.

    - dnssec-nodes  - This graphical DNS debugging utility was greatly enhanced
                    - Now parses both bind and libval log files
                    - Multiple log files can be watched
                    - Node's represent multiple data sets
                      internally, which are independently displayed
                      and tracked.
                    - Added support for searching for and
                      highlighting DNS data and DNSSEC status
                      results

    - dnssec-system-tray
                    - This utility can now report on BOGUS responses
                      detected in both libval and bind log files.
                    - Summary window revamped to group similar
                      messages together.

 Plus many more minor features and bug fixes

1.10
 - New Features:
    - New Apps:     (see the validator/apps directory for details)
                    - dnssec-check: check dnssec support from your ISP
                    - dnssec-nodes: graphically displays a DNS
                      hierarchy, color coded by each node's DNSSEC status
                    - dnssec-system-tray: displays pop-up
                      notifications when a libval-enabled application
                      triggers a DNSSEC error
                    - lookup: a graphical DNS lookup utility that
                      displays the results in a hierarchical tree and
                      color codes the window according to DNSSEC status
    - libval:       - Added support for building on Windows.
      & libsres     - added support for falling back to recursion when
                      the caching name server does not appear to 
                      support DNSSEC. This also works as a mechanism
                      to work around a poisoned or misbehaving cache. 
                    - Significant improvements to the asynchronous support. 
    - lsdnssec:     - Improvements to lsdnssec to display different
                      output depending on whether a zone is a
                      stand-alone zone or under control of rollerd.
    - nagios:       - Plugins for the nagios monitoring system which
                      enable monitoring of zone rollover states.
    - firefox:      - Updated patches that work with the most recent firefox

 Plus many more minor features and bug fixes

1.9
 - New Features:
    - lsdnssec:     - Added a new flag (-p) to show only zones in a
                      particular rollerd phase.
                    - fixed bugs to align timing output with rollerd.
    - rollerd:      - Added a -logtz flag for logging timezones
                    - fixed bugs related to the -alwayssign flag.
                    - zonesigner's path is taken from the config file.
    - rollctl:      - Added -rollall and -rollzone options.
    - zonesigner:   - Assumes keys need to be generated for new zones
                      (Assumes -genkeys option was given if a keyrec file
                      can't be found.)
                    - Exits with unique exit codes if a failure occurs.
                      ("zonesigner -xc CODE" can lookup a description for it.")
                    - Added the -phase option so rollover options could be
                      more easily specified.
    - lights:       - A simple GUI to check the status of rollover states
    - blinkenlights:- Added hide/show commands for rollrec names and zone
                      names, for split-zone support
    - cleankrf:	    - Fixed deletion of obsolete set keyrecs.
    - GUI commands: - Fixed how the Exit command works so they don't coredump.
    - libsres
      & libval:     - New beta support for issuing asynchronous requests.
                      This can speed up queries by up to 4 times if used.
                      (see example code in validator/apps/validator_selftest.c)
                    - NSEC3, DLV and IPv6 are enabled by default.
                    - improved logging and logging-callback support.
    - drawvalmap    - Can output PNG files now

 - Packaging:
                    - Our download page now allows you to download
                      the C validator libraries independently of the
                      full DNNSEC-Tools tool-suite.

 - Many bugs were also fixed in the 240+ changes.

1.8
 - New Features:
    - zonesigner, rollerd
                    - Made changes so that these tools are more compatible 
                      with recent versions of Bind
                    - The zone_errors configuration parameter allows a zone-
                      specific maximum to be set.  Once exceeded, that zone
                      will be skipped rather than allowing rollover to continue.
    - blinkenlights
                    - Recognizes when rollerd abruptly quits, so error messages
                      aren't spewed interminably.
    - ZonFile::Fast - Fixed parsing of DS records containing spaces and 
                      parsing of mname and rname SOA fields
                    - Added support for parsing KEY records
    - keyrec.pm     - Made changes to properly lock keyrec files before 
                      writing to them.
                    - Begun process of deprecating keyrec_open().
    - mapper:       - added a new option: --node-size for mapping
                      complex zones.
    - dnspktflow:   - added two new options:
                      --layout-style for selecting the layout style to use
                      --node-size for mapping complex zones.
                    - Add new (default) option to cluster
                      authoritative nodes together to help better
                      understand the relationships between traffic
                      patterns and authoritative name server/zone arrangement.
    - libval:       - Now distributed with the Root TA.
                    - Added stricter checks for openssl SHA-256 support in 
                      configure. 
                    - Added several improvements that allow the validator to 
                      lookup information within provably insecure zones that 
                      do not handle EDNS0 requests nicely. This includes 
                      adding support for turning off EDNS0 when traversing a 
                      name hierarchy that leads to a provably insecure zone, 
                      EDNS0 fallback support, and additional checks to check 
                      the sanity of response data.
                    - Fixed certain bugs in CNAME handling and in the 
                      validation of proofs accompanying wildcard responses, 
                      referrals and alias chains.
                    - Fixed support for RSADSA and RSASHA-512 signature 
                      validation.
    - Mac OSX:      - Added a Ports file for mac ports
                    - updated the fink build spec

 - many other miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.

1.7
 - New Features:
    - zonesigner:   - Added support for split-views. 
    - rollerd:      - supports the ability to run as a given (non-root) user-id.
                    - Refined the status messages generated for various 
                      rollover phases.
                    - logging  more information when an error is returned 
                      by various rollerd functions and sub-processes.
    - libval:       - Added support for RSA/SHA256-512 validation 
    - test suite:   - Added new test cases for trustman
                    - Many other refinements. 
    - applications: - Most application patches updated so that they apply 
                      to the current upstream release version.
    - convertar:    - added a --tods flag for converting keys to DS records

 - Bug Fixes
    - libval:       - Fixed a number of issues in the validator library 
                      for NSEC3 validation, execution on 64-bit
                      machines, and in the treatment of NODATA and 
                      referral conditions. 
                    - Fixed an issue in the where it was not correctly 
                      down-casing the names prior to validating DNSSEC
                      signatures. 
    - trustman:     - Fixed trustman's operation when revoking and 
                      replacing keys during a RFC 5011 revoke
                      operation.
    - rollerd:      - Fixed a problem where the path exceeded the maximum 
                      length for Unix socket names. 
                    - Modified the rollerd GUI so that it did not
                      print out error messages when it was invoked
                      when rollerd wasn't running.
                    - fixed rollerd support for nsec3 zones

 - New Features:
    - convertar:    - A new tool to translate a trust-anchor-repository
                      (TAR) from one format to another.  Supports
                      itar, xml, csv, bind, and libval TA formats.
    - rollerd:      - A new -noreload option to rollerd to not call rndc
    - dtconfchk     - Improved support for checking dnssec-tools.conf
                      content validity
    - dtinitconf:   - -genroothints supports fetching root.hints from the web
    - zonesigner:   - Supports setting the revoke bit
    - rollmgr:      - Supports Solaris now
    - lskrf         - Supports output of revoked keys
    - test suite:   - A new test suite for testing the tools (cd testing;
                      make test)
    - binaries:     - Support for producing self-contained
                      packed-binaries of the tools.  You can download
                      ones we build from http://www.dnssec-tools.org/download/
    - dtreqmods:    - A new script to check for DNSSEC-Tools required
                      perl modules.

    - libval changes:
                     - Changed function prototypes and error codes to keep 
                       them compliant with the current (-07) Validator API 
                       draft 
                     - Added initial RFC 5155 NSEC3 support 
                       (configure --with-nsec3)
                     - Optimized the referral processing and glue fetching 
                       logic so that libval does a better job in trying to 
                       determine the referral zonecut, and so that it is less 
                       aggressive in fetching missing glue. Also allow for glue 
                       to be fetched on demand. 
                     - Miscellaneous bug fixes

   - dnspktflow:   - Added output options for svg, svgz, and postscript

 - Bug fixes
   - libval:       - should compile better on more OSes
   - rollerd:      - Fixed the -zsargs option in most rollerd related tools
                   - Other minor fixes
   - zonesigner:   - fixed serial number auto-incrementing
            

1.4.1
 - Security Issue:
   The DNSSEC-Tools libval validating resolver library does suffer
   from the same issues that the other DNS resolvers were faced with
   as described by:    http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113

   Although DNSSEC will prevent the issues, it is assumed that not
   everyone is using libval with only 100% DNSSEC protected zones.

   The supporting tools that do not use libval are not affected by
   this problem (eg, zonesigner, rollerd, donuts, etc are just fine).

 - NSEC3 value change

   Now that the NSEC3 RFC has been published we've changed the
   internal numeric RR code to the assigned value.  The NSEC3 code,
   however, is still considered experimental and not fully tested.

1.4

 
 - Documentation:
   - Much more extensive documentation has been written about the
     tools and how to get started using them.  See the following web
     page for details:

     http://www.dnssec-tools.org/wiki/index.php/Tutorials

 - Applications:
   - trustman has seen a lot of usability improvements and now has
     more extensive documentation.
   - rollerd and it's controlling scripts can now handle user
     initiated KSK rollovers.
   - zonesigner handles keys stored in other directories better.
   - donuts output has been made more user friendly and the verbosity
     level can now be more finely tuned.
   - donuts rule definitions have been cleaned up and the API for
     writing rules has been simplified.

 - libval
   - There have been a number of minor API changes in libval
   - Support was added for environment and app name-based policies in libval
   - Initial release of the libval_shim library (LD_PRELOAD-based
     approach for transparently enabling validation for various
     applications)
   - The perl Net::DNS::SEC::Validator binding has been updated to
     accomodate the libval changes.

 - Many more minor changes and improvements

    - A threaded or non-threaded version can now be created
         (--without-threads)
    - Added support for anti-pollution rules; libval no longer caches out- 
      of-bailiwick answers
    - Made return values for validation status consistent across all
      high-level API functions. It is now possible to detect in
      val_getaddrinfo() if an RRset is provably missing
    - fix val_res_query() to properly return the size of the received
      response;

0.9.1:
  - validator library (dnssec-tools/validator):
    - code has been re-structured within the following 
      sub-directories: 
      libsres/ libval/ doc/ etc/ apps/ and include/
    - configures and builds cleanly on the following systems: 
      Fedora, MacOSX, FreeBSD
      (should configure and build on Solaris -- not actually tested)   
    - includes support for tuning "off" DNSSEC using the
      "zone-security-expectation" policy construct. 
    - APIs modified to comply with (upcoming version of) 
      draft-draft-hayatnagarkar-dnsext-validator-api
 
  - dtinitconf, dtconfchk, dtdefs:
    - these tools are used to create, check and consult the 
      file dnssec-tools.conf which is used by many of the
      dnssec tools. dtconfchk was previously known as confchk.
     
    - modules/defaults.pm was also added to provide defaults
      for the above tools.

  - rollinit, rollctl, rollchk, rollerd, lsroll:
    - these tools are used to create, check, and list the roll
      rec files to be used by rollerd and rollctl.

    - rollerd is a daemon to manage DNSSEC key roll-over.

    - rollctl is used to send commands to a rollerd daemon.

  - TrustMan:
    - manages keys used as trust anchors in named.conf and
      dnsval.conf
    - can be run as a daemon or as a one-time check
    - configuration is placed in dnssec-tools.conf

  - donuts:
    - supports a --show-gui flag to display a graphical
      error browser (requires perl QWizard and Gtk2 modules).
    - A better (optional) GUI interface for new users

  - Most tools should report a --version flag. 

  - Other minor improvements have been made to other tools and
    supporting files.
