 - Bug Fixes
    - libval:       - Fixed a number of issues in the validator library 
                      for NSEC3 validation, execution on 64-bit
                      machines, and in the treatment of NODATA and 
                      referral conditions. 
                    - Fixed an issue in the where it was not correctly 
                      down-casing the names prior to validating DNSSEC
                      signatures. 
    - trustman:     - Fixed trustman's operation when revoking and 
                      replacing keys during a RFC 5011 revoke
                      operation.
    - rollerd:      - Fixed a problem where the path exceeded the maximum 
                      length for Unix socket names. 
                    - Modified the rollerd GUI so that it did not
                      print out error messages when it was invoked
                      when rollerd wasn't running.
                    - fixed rollerd support for nsec3 zones

1.6

    - convertar:    - A new tool to translate a trust-anchor-repository
                      (TAR) from one format to another.  Supports
                      itar, xml, csv, bind, and libval TA formats.
    - rollerd:      - A new -noreload option to rollerd to not call rndc
    - dtconfchk     - Improved support for checking dnssec-tools.conf
                      content validity
    - dtinitconf:   - -genroothints supports fetching root.hints from the web
    - zonesigner:   - Supports setting the revoke bit
    - rollmgr:      - Supports Solaris now
    - lskrf         - Supports output of revoked keys

    - binaries:     - Support for producing self-contained
                      packed-binaries of the tools.  You can download
                      ones we build from http://www.dnssec-tools.org/download/
    - dtreqmods:    - A new script to check for DNSSEC-Tools required
                      perl modules.

    - libval changes:
                     - Changed function prototypes and error codes to keep 
                       them compliant with the current (-07) Validator API 
                       draft 
                     - Added initial RFC 5155 NSEC3 support 
                       (configure --with-nsec3)
                     - Optimized the referral processing and glue fetching 
                       logic so that libval does a better job in trying to 
                       determine the referral zonecut, and so that it is less 
                       aggressive in fetching missing glue. Also allow for glue 
                       to be fetched on demand.

              	   - Other minor fixes
   - zonesigner:   - fixed serial number auto-incrementing
            

1.4.1
 - Security Issue:
   The DNSSEC-Tools libval validating resolver library does suffer
   from the same issues that the other DNS resolvers were faced with
   as described by:    http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113

   Although DNSSEC will prevent the issues, it is assumed that not
   everyone is using libval with only 100% DNSSEC protected zones.

   The supporting tools that do not use libval are not affected by
   this problem (eg, zonesigner, rollerd, donuts, etc are just fine).

 - NSEC3 value change

   Now that the NSEC3 RFC has been published we've changed the
   internal numeric RR code to the assigned value.  The NSEC3 code,
   however, is still considered experimental and not fully tested.

1.4

 
 - Documentation:
   - Much more extensive documentation has been written about the
     tools and how to get started using them.  See the following web
     page for details:

     http://www.dnssec-tools.org/wiki/index.php/Tutorials

 - Applications:
   - trustman has seen a lot of usability improvements and now has
     more extensive documentation.
   - rollerd and it's controlling scripts can now handle user
     initiated KSK rollovers.
   - zonesigner handles keys stored in other directories better.
   - donuts output has been made more user friendly and the verbosity
     level can now be more finely tuned.
   - donuts rule definitions have been cleaned up and the API for
     writing rules has been simplified.

 - libval
   - There have been a number of minor API changes in libval
   - Support was added for environment and app name-based policies in libval
   - Initial release of the libval_shim library (LD_PRELOAD-based
     approach for transparently enabling validation for various
     applications)
   - The perl Net::DNS::SEC::Validator binding has been updated to
     accomodate the libval changes.

 - Many more minor changes and improvements

0.9.1:
  - validator library (dnssec-tools/validator):
    - code has been re-structured within the following 
      sub-directories: 
      libsres/ libval/ doc/ etc/ apps/ and include/
    - configures and builds cleanly on the following systems: 
      Fedora, MacOSX, FreeBSD
      (should configure and build on Solaris -- not actually tested)   
    - includes support for tuning "off" DNSSEC using the
      "zone-security-expectation" policy construct. 
    - APIs modified to comply with (upcoming version of) 
      draft-draft-hayatnagarkar-dnsext-validator-api
 
  - dtinitconf, dtconfchk, dtdefs:
    - these tools are used to create, check and consult the 
      file dnssec-tools.conf which is used by many of the
      dnssec tools. dtconfchk was previously known as confchk.
     
    - modules/defaults.pm was also added to provide defaults
      for the above tools.

  - rollinit, rollctl, rollchk, rollerd, lsroll:
    - these tools are used to create, check, and list the roll
      rec files to be used by rollerd and rollctl.

    - rollerd is a daemon to manage DNSSEC key roll-over.

    - rollctl is used to send commands to a rollerd daemon.

  - TrustMan:
    - manages keys used as trust anchors in named.conf and
      dnsval.conf
    - can be run as a daemon or as a one-time check
    - configuration is placed in dnssec-tools.conf

  - donuts:
    - supports a --show-gui flag to display a graphical
      error browser (requires perl QWizard and Gtk2 modules).
    - A better (optional) GUI interface for new users

  - Most tools should report a --version flag. 

  - Other minor improvements have been made to other tools and
    supporting files.
