This file contains a list of major changes per release.

0.9.1:
  - validator library (dnssec-tools/validator):
                - code has been re-structured within the following 
                  sub-directories: 
                  libsres/ libval/ doc/ etc/ apps/ and include/
                - configures and builds cleanly on the following systems: 
                  Fedora, MacOSX, FreeBSD
                  (should configure and build on Solaris -- not actually tested)   
                - includes support for tuning "off" DNSSEC using the
                  "zone-security-expectation" policy construct. 
                - APIs modified to comply with (upcoming version of) 
                  draft-draft-hayatnagarkar-dnsext-validator-api
 
  - dtinitconf, dtconfchk, dtdefs:
                - these tools are used to create, check and consult the 
                  file dnssec-tools.conf which is used by many of the
                  dnssec tools. dtconfchk was previously known as confchk.
                 
                - modules/defaults.pm was also added to provide defaults
                  for the above tools.

  - rollinit, rollctl, rollchk, rollerd, lsroll:
                - these tools are used to create, check, and list the roll
                  rec files to be used by rollerd and rollctl.

                - rollerd is a daemon to manage DNSSEC key roll-over.

                - rollctl is used to send commands to a rollerd daemon.

  - TrustMan:
                - manages keys used as trust anchors in named.conf and
                  dnsval.conf
                - can be run as a daemon or as a one-time check
                - configuration is placed in dnssec-tools.conf

  - donuts:
		- supports a --show-gui flag to display a graphical
		  error browser (requires perl QWizard and Gtk2 modules).
		- A better (optional) GUI interface for new users

  - Most tools should report a --version flag. 

  - Other minor improvements have been made to other tools and
    supporting files.
