			     DNSSEC-Tools
			Is your domain secure?

OVERVIEW

  The goal of the DNSSEC-Tools project is to create a set of tools,
  patches, applications, wrappers, extensions, and plugins that will
  help ease the deployment of DNSSEC-related technologies.

ABOUT THE TOOLS

  For more information about this project and the tools that are being
  developed and provided, please see our project web page at:

    http://www.dnssec-tools.org/

INSTALLATION

  Most of the tools, perl modules, and other things described on the
  web page above are easily installed by following the instructions in
  the INSTALL file.  However, some of the results of this package are
  patches to external programs that will hopefully be fed back into
  those projects where possible.  In the meantime, there are patches
  included within this source tree that can be applied to those other
  projects.

CONTENTS DESCRIPTION

  The various pieces of the DNSSEC-Tools project are spread across several
  directories.  These pieces are briefly described here.

  Most of the tools take a --version flag to let you know their
  individual version number.  The numbers reported will be < 0.9 if
  they're to be considered "alpha" quality.  If >= 0.9 and < 1.0 then
  they should be considered "beta".  Version numbers of 1.0 and above
  should be considered more well-tested, robust and less likely to
  change.

        apps/libspf2-1.x.y_dnssec
                Patches to libspf2 to provide DNSSEC validation of DNS
                queries.

        apps/mozilla
                Patches to mozilla 1.7.10 to enable DNSSEC name
                checking validation on visited URLs.

        apps/sendmail
                Patches to sendmail and spfmilter to provide DNSSEC
                validation of DNS queries.

        apps/thunderbird
                A thunderbird extension to display the x-dnssec field
                in the Received-SPF header.

        validator/libsres
                A library that is capable of sending queries to, and
                receiving answers from a DNSSEC-aware name server.

        validator/libval
                A library that provides DNSSEC resource-record
                validation functionality.

	validator/apps/validate
		A tool which can display the sequence of queries and
		their results used to validate a DNS query.  The
		stderr output of this command can serve as input to
		the drawvalmap tool described below.

        tools/dnspktflow
                A tool which can produce visual diagrams of DNS
                traffic flows which have been captured using tcpdump.

        tools/donuts
                A dnssec aware zone file checker / lint-like application.

        tools/donutsd
                Runs donuts on zone files on a regular bases (eg,
                daily) and emails the results.  Useful for knowing
                when zone data breaks due to DNSSEC signatures
                expiring or other data consistency issues).

	tools/drawvalmap
		A variation of dnspktflow which can produce visual
		diagrams of DNS queries sent by the validator
		while performing DNSSEC validation.  The input for
		this command can come from the validate tool described
		above.

        tools/etc       
                Data required by DNSSEC-Tools programs.

        tools/linux/ifup-dyn-dns
                This is a script which can be used to securely
                auto-update a DNS entry when an IP address is assigned
                to an interface.

        tools/logwatch
                Patches to logwatch configuration files and scripts to
                manage log files for BIND security function.  These
                patches are now included in the recent releases of
                logwatch and may not be needed if you have a recent
                release.

        tools/mapper
                A tool that can generate graphical maps of DNS zones,
                including color coding of DNSSEC related data.

        tools/modules
                DNSSEC-Tools Perl modules.  These modules provide interfaces
                for such things as reading configuration files and manipulating
                DNSSEC-Tools-specific data.

        tools/patches
                Patch files to be applied to existing programs.

        tools/scripts
                Perl scripts for signing DNSSEC zones and maintaining those
                signed zones.  See the tools/scripts/README file for details.
