			     DNSSEC-Tools
			Is your domain secure?

OVERVIEW

  The goal of the DNSSEC-Tools project is to create a set of tools,
  patches, applications, wrappers, extensions, and plugins that will
  help ease the deployment of DNSSEC-related technologies.

ABOUT THE TOOLS

  For more information about this project and the tools that are being
  developed and provided, please see our project web page at:

    http://www.dnssec-tools.org/

INSTALLATION

  Most of the tools, perl modules, and other things described on the
  web page above are easily installed by following the instructions in
  the INSTALL file.  However, some of the results of this package are
  patches to external programs that will hopefully be fed back into
  those projects where possible.  In the meantime, there are patches
  included within this source tree that can be applied to those other
  projects.

CONTENTS DESCRIPTION

  The various pieces of the DNSSEC-Tools project are spread across several
  directories.  These pieces are briefly described here.
