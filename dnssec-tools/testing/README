			Is your domain secure?


This directory contains a number of tests for the DNSSEC-Tools utilities.
These tests are run by the make command, passing the targets listed
below.  Both verbose and (relatively) quiet tests are available.

The following utilities are tested:  zonesigner, donuts, donutsd, trustman,
and rollerd.  There are also tests for trustman/rollerd interaction.


Running the Tests

	Typing "make" will run the complete suite of tests.

	In order to run a subset of tests, run "make" with test appropriate
	target.  For example, "make rollerd" will run the rollerd tests.

	Given the large volume of extra output provided by the verbose tests,
	it is probably better to start with the quiet tests and only use the
	verbose tests if a problem was found.  For example, run "make donuts"
	to run the donuts tests; follow that with "make donutsv" if any of
	the tests have problems.

    For the testman tests, validator configuration information is read
    from the $dnssec-tools/validator/etc/dnsval.conf file. The 
    rec-fallback global policy in this file MUST be set to 'no' for the 
    trustman tests to succeed:
        global-options
          ... 
          rec-fallback no
        ;
