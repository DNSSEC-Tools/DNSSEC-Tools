DNSSEC Validation library
-------------------------

A library that provides DNSSEC resource-record validation functionality.

Description and Current Status
------------------------------

This library provides basic functionality for resource-record validation.  It
relies on the resolver component (see ../libsres/README for more details) to
fetch answers from a DNSSEC-aware name server.

As of now there is no functionality to traverse the chain-of-trust while
performing record validation and also no support for validation policies.
As such, the interfaces defined herein are in a state of flux and are almost
certainly expected to change.

Using the library
-----------------

First run the configure script from the dnssec-tools directory:

	./configure

To compile:

	make clean; make

To install:

	make install;

To run the resolver-driver:

	./driver

To run the verifier:

	./verify [[CLASS] TYPE] DOMAIN_NAME

     If CLASS is not provided, it is assumed to be IN.
     If TYPE is not provided, it is assumed to be A.

The verify program will not do chain-validation.  It will just check
that the DNSKEY can correctly verify the signature on a given resource
record.

To run gethost:

	./gethost <hostname>
