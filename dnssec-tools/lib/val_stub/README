To compile:

	make clean; make

To run the resolver-driver:

	./driver

To run the verifier:

	./verify [[CLASS] TYPE] DOMAIN_NAME

     If CLASS is not provided, it is assumed to be IN.
     If TYPE is not provided, it is assumed to be A.

The verify program will not do chain-validation.  It will just check
that the DNSKEY can correctly verify the signature on a given resource
record.
