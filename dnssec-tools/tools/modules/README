This directory contains DNSSEC-Tools-specific Perl modules.  Each file has a
pod man page which may be consulted for details.

	BootStrap.pm
		Determines at run-time, rather than at installation time, if
		the right modules are available on the system.

	QWPrimitives.pm
		QWizard primitives for DNSSEC-Tools.

	conf.pm
		Parses the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file.

	defaults.pm
		Contains default values for DNSSEC-Tools programs.

	dnssectools.pm
		Catch-all module for DNSSEC-Tools routines that don't fit
		in with other modules.

	keyrec.pm
		Manages a DNSSEC-Tools keyrec file.  Keyrec files maintain
		meta-information about DNSSEC-signed DNS zones.

	rolllog.pm
		Interfaces for manipulating the rollerd log.

	rollmgr.pm
		Provides communications interfaces with a DNSSEC-signed DNS
		zone roll-over manager daemon.

		Beware, here be monsters...  This is a alpha code.

	rollrec.pm
		Manages a DNSSEC-Tools rollrec file.  Rollrec files maintain
		meta-information about roll-over status of DNSSEC-signed DNS
		zones.

		DO NOT USE.  This isn't even in a pre-alpha state.  This is
		in a primordial state.

	timetrans.pm
		Converts an integer seconds count into equivalent text units.

	tooloptions.pm
		Parses command line options, and combines them with the
		DNSSEC-Tools configuration file data and keyrec files to
		determine the final set of options values to be used by
		DNSSEC-Tools programs.
