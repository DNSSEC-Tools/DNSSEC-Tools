=head1 NAME

Net::DNS::SEC::Tools::conf - DNSSEC-Tools configuration routines.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::DNS::SEC::Tools::conf;

  %dtconf = parseconfig();

  %dtconf = parseconfig("localzone.keyrec");

  cmdcheck(\%options_hashref);

  $confdir = getconfdir();

  $conffile = getconffile();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The routines in this module perform configuration operations.
Some routines access the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file, while others
validate the execution environment.

The DNSSEC tools have a configuration file for commonly used values.
These values are the defaults for a variety of things, such as
encryption algorithm and encryption key length.

B</usr/local/etc/dnssec/dnssec-tools.conf> is the path for the DNSSEC tools
configuration file.  The B<Net::DNS::SEC::Tools::conf> module provides
methods for accessing the configuration data in this file.

The DNSSEC tools configuration file consists of a set of configuration
value entries, with only one entry per line.  Each entry has the
"keyword value" format.  During parsing, the line is broken into
tokens, with tokens being separated by spaces and tabs.  The first
token in a line is taken to be the keyword.  All other tokens in that
line are concatenated into a single string, with a space separating
each token.  The untokenized string is added to a hash table, with the
keyword as the value's key.

Comments may be included by prefacing them with the '#' or ';'
comment characters.  These comments can encompass an entire line or may
follow a configuration entry.  If a comment shares a line with an entry,
value tokenization stops just prior to the comment character.

An example configuration file follows:

    # Sample configuration entries.

    algorithm       rsasha1     # Encryption algorithm.
    ksk_length      1024        ; KSK key length.

=head1 INTERFACES

=over 4

=item B<parseconfig()>

This routine reads and parses the system's DNSSEC tools configuration file.
The parsed contents are put into a hash table, which is returned to the caller.

=item B<parseconfig(conffile)>

This routine reads and parses a caller-specified DNSSEC tools configuration
file.  The parsed contents are put into a hash table, which is returned to
the caller.  The routine quietly returns if the configuration file does not
exist. 

=item B<cmdcheck(\%options_hashref)>

This routine ensures that the needed commands are available and
executable.  If any of the commands either don't exist or aren't executable,
then an error message will be given and the process will exit.  If all is
well, everything will proceed quietly onwards.

The commands keys currently checked are I<zonecheck>, I<keygen>, and
I<zonesign>.  The pathnames for these commands are found in the given options
hash referenced by I<%options_hashref>.  If the hash doesn't contain an entry
for one of those commands, it is not checked.

=item B<getconfdir()>

This routine returns the name of the DNSSEC-Tools configuration directory.

=item B<getconffile()>

This routine returns the name of the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file.
