   constants and utility functions related to the POSIX getaddrinfo()
   system call. (see: man 3 getaddrinfo)

   the latest DNSSEC-Tools distribution available from:

Release Notes:

   The initial beta release of this extension module has been
   developed against perl-5.8.8.

   This module is modeled after 'Net::hostent' but has some
   additional features and does not rely on Class::Struct.


KNOWN BUGS:

   No *known* bugs.

Installation:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test			(must have access to DNS)
   make install			(requires root privilege)

Operational Description:

   use Net::addrinfo;
   my $ainfo = getaddrinfo("www.marzot.net");

   use Socket qw(:all);
   my $hint = new Net::addrinfo(flags => AI_CANONNAME,
                                family => AF_INET, 
                                socktype => SOCK_DGRAM);
   $ainfo = getaddrinfo("www.marzot.net", "http", $hint);

   if (ref($ainfo) eq 'ARRAY') {
      $ainfo = $ainfo->[0];
      print $ainfo->canonname, "\n";
   ...
      connect(SH, $ainfo->addr);
   } else {
      print "Error($ainfo):", gai_strerror($ainfo), "\n";
   }

Trouble Shooting:

   Check that 'make test' succeeds.

   Check that DNS connectivity is available.

   If you cannot resolve the problem you can email
   dnssec-tools-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

   Please give sufficient information to analyze the problem (OS type,
   versions for OS/perl/compiler, complete error output, etc.)
