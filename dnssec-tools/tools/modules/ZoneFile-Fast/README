Usage:

  use Net::DNS::ZoneFile::Fast;

  my $rr = Net::DNS::ZoneFile::Fast::parse($zone_text);

Description:

  The Net::DNS::ZoneFile::Fast module provides an ability to parse zone
  files that BIND8 and BIND9 use, fast.  Currently it provides a single
  function, parse(), which returns a reference to an array of
  traditional Net::DNS::RR objects, so that no new API has to be
  learned in order to manipulate zone records.

  Great care was taken to ensure that parse() does its job as fast as
  possible, so it is interesting to use this module to parse huge zones.
  As an example datapoint, it takes less than 5 seconds to parse a 2.2 MB
  zone with about 72000 records on an Athlon XP 2600+ box.

  On the other hand, it is likely that Net::DNS::RR objects that
  parse() returns are going to be further processed.  To make it easier
  to link any record back to the zone file (say, to report a logical error
  like infamous `CNAME and other data' back to the user, or to do a zone
  file modification), parse() inserts line numbering information into
  Net::DNS::RR objects.
