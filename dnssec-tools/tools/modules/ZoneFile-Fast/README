Usage:

  use Net::DNS::ZoneFile::Fast;

  my $rr = Net::DNS::ZoneFile::Fast::parse($zone_text);

Description:

  The Net::DNS::ZoneFile::Fast module provides an ability to parse zone
  files that BIND8 and BIND9 use, fast.  Currently it provides a single
  function, I<parse()>, which returns a reference to an array of
  traditional I<Net::DNS::RR> objects, so that no new API has to be
  learned in order to manipulate zone records.

  Great care was taken to ensure that I<parse()> does its job as fast as
  possible, so it is interesting to use this module to parse huge zones.
  As an example datapoint, it takes less than 5 seconds to parse a 2.2 MB
  zone with about 72000 records on an Athlon XP 2600+ box.

  On the other hand, it is likely that I<Net::DNS::RR> objects that
  I<parse()> returns are going to be further processed.  To make it easier
  to link any record back to the zone file (say, to report a logical error
  like infamous `CNAME and other data' back to the user, or to do a zone
  file modification), I<parse()> inserts line numbering information into
  I<Net::DNS::RR> objects.
