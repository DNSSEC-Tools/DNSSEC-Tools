Introduction:

This Perl module is designed to implement and export functionality
provided by the validating DNS resolver library, libval(3). The
functions are provided through an easy-to-use object oriented
interface. The interface is designed for the higher level user, hiding
some of the complexity of validating resolvers. Nevertheless,
application interface behavior can be customized through configuration
files provided by libval(3) and extensive error codes returned.

Details of DNSSEC and associated resolver behavior may be found in the
core DNSSEC RFCs (4033-4035).

Availability:

   The most recent release of this module can be found bundled with
   the latest DNSSEC-Tools distribution available from:

	http://www.dnssec-tools.org/resources/download.html

   This module should also be available through CPAN

	http://www.cpan.org

Contact:

   The following mailing list should be consider the primary support
   mechanism for this module:

	     dnssec-tools-users@lists.sourceforge.net mail list

   For bugs use:

	     dnssec-tools-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net mail list

Release Notes:

   The initial beta release of this extension module has been
   developed against perl-5.8.8.

   Only high level API functions are provided. Lower level API
   functions will be provided in a future release.

Known Bugs:

   See the DNSSEC-Tools Bug Database:

      http://www.dnssec-tools.org/trac/

Installation:

Libval(3) and related dnssec-tools headers and configuration files
should first be installed. Also Net::addrinfo and Net::DNS modules
should be installed.

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test			(must have access to DNS)
   make install			(requires root privilege)


Operational Description:

Contructor:

To create a validator object use the Net::DNS::SEC::Validator->new()
method. This method optionally takes a policy label (policy =>
'label'), or default to using the default label in the libval(3)
dnsval.conf file.

Data Fields:

$validator->{error}		=> the latest method error code
$validator->{errorStr}		=> the latest method error string
$validator->{valStatus}		=> the val_status of last call (if single)
$validator->{valStatusStr}	=> the val_status string of last call


Methods:

$validator->getaddrinfo(<name>[,<service>[,<hints>]])
   where
      <name> 	=> is the node name or numeric address being queried
      <service> => is the name or number represting the service
		   (note: <name> or <service> may be undef, but not both)
      <hint>	=> a Net::addrinfo object specying flags, family, etc.

   returns:
      	an array of Net::addrinfo objects (augmented with a 'val_status'
	field). On error, returns an empty array. in scalar context
	returns first Net::addrinfo object, or undef on error.
                  
$validator->gethostbyname(<name>[,<family>])
   where
      <name> 	=> is the node name or numeric address being queried
      <family> 	=> the address family of returned entry (default: AF_INET)

   returns:
      	A Net::hostent object. Validator valStatus/valStatusStr fields
	will be updated. On error, undef is returned and validator object
	error/errorStr fields are updated.
                  
$validator->res_query(<name>[,<class>[,<type>]])
   where
      <name> 	=> is the node name or numeric address being queried
      <class> 	=> is the DNS class of the record being queried (default: IN)
      <type>	=> is the DNS record type being queried (defailt A)

   returns:
	A packed DNS query result is returned on success. This object is
	suitable to be passed to the Net::DNS::Packet(\$result)
	interface for parsing. Validator valStatus/valStatusStr fields
	will be updated. On error, undef is returned and validator
	object error/errorStr fields are updated.

$validator->resolve_and_check(<name>[, <class>[, <type> [, <flags>]]])
   where
      <name> 	=> is the node name or numeric address being queried
      <class> 	=> is the DNS class of the record being queried (default: IN)
      <type>	=> is the DNS record type being queried (defailt A)
      <flags>	=> are the libval resolve_and_check control flags

   returns:
	returns a complex data structure of all answers and proofs
	related to given query:

        result = [{status, <proofs>, <answer>}, ...]
	proofs = [<auth_chain>, ...]
	answer = <auth_chain>
	auth_chain = {status, <rrset>, <trust>}
	trust = <auth_chain>
	rrset = {<data>, <sigs>}
	data = {rrstatus, <rrdata>}  
	sigs = {rrstatus, <rrdata>}  
    rrdata = [Net::DNS::RR, ...]

	On error undef will be returned and validator
	object error/errorStr fields are updated.

$validator->policy([<label>])
   where
      <label> 	=> the policy label to use (old context is destroyed)
			(default: ":" dnsval.conf default policy)

   returns:
      	the policy label currently (after change) being used.
                  
$validator->istrusted([<val_status>])
   where
      <val_status> => numeric vaildator status code
		   	(default: $validator->{valStatus})

   returns:
      	A boolean positive value if <val_status> is a trusted result.
                  
$validator->valStatusStr([<val_status>])
   where
      <val_status> => numeric vaildator status code
		   	(default: $validator->{valStatus})

   returns:
      	A string representation of the given <val_status>.
                  
                         
Examples

use Net::DNS::SEC::Validator;
use Net::DNS::Packet;
use Net::hostent;
use Net::addrinfo;
use Socket qw(:all);

# construct object
my $validator = new Net::DNS::SEC::Validator(policy => ":");

# change validation policy
$validator->policy("validate_tools:");

# fetch array of Net::addrinfo objects
my (@r) = $validator->getaddrinfo("good-A.test.dnssec-tools.org");
foreach $a (@r) {
    print $a->stringify, " is trusted\n"
	if $validator->istrusted($a->val_status));
}

# query an MX record
my $r = $validator->res_query("marzot.net", "IN", "MX");
my ($pkt, $err) = new Net::DNS::Packet(\$r);
print ($validator->istrusted ? 
	"result is trusted\n" : 
	"result is NOT trusted\n");

my $h = $validator->gethostbyname("good-A.test.dnssec-tools.org");
if ( @{$h->addr_list}) { 
my $i;
   for $addr ( @{$h->addr_list} ) {
	printf "\taddr #%d is [%s]\n", $i++, inet_ntoa($addr);
   } 
}


Trouble Shooting:

Check that 'make test' succeeds.

Check that DNS connectivity is available and that there is a clear
path of security-aware servers involved with the query.

If you cannot resolve the problem you can email
dnssec-tools-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

Please give sufficient information to analyze the problem (OS type,
versions for OS/perl/compiler, complete error output, etc.)

Updating:

   The latest copy of the module was produced via h2xs in the
   validator/include/validator directory as follows:

     h2xs -b 5.6.0 -n Net-DNS-Sec-Validator *.h

   Then manually updating previous versions of the Validator.xs file
   as needed.
