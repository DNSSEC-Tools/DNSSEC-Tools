=head1 NAME

B<rollrec> - Rollover-related zone data used by DNSSEC-Tools programs.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<rollrec> files contain data used by the DNSSEC-Tools to manage key rollover.
A I<rollrec> file is organized in sets of I<rollrec> records.  Each I<rollrec>
record describes the rollover state of a single zone and must be either of
I<roll> type or I<skip> type.  Zone I<rollrec>s record information about
currently rolling zones.  Skip I<rollrec>s record information about zones that
are not being rolled.  A I<rollrec> consists of a set of keyword/value
entries.

The DNSSEC-Tools B<rollrec.pm> module manipulates the contents of a I<rollrec>
file.  Module interfaces exist for looking up I<rollrec> records, creating
new records, and modifying existing records.

Comment lines and blank lines are ignored by the DNSSEC-Tools programs.
Comment lines start with either a '#' character or a ';' character.

A I<rollrec>'s name may consist of alphabetic characters, numbers, and several
special characters.  The special characters are the minus sign, the plus sign,
the underscore, the comma, the period, the colon, the forward-slash, the
space, and the tab.

The values in a I<rollrec>'s entries may consist of alphabetic characters,
numbers, and several special characters.  The special characters are the minus
sign, the plus sign, the underscore, the comma, the period, the colon, the
forward-slash, the space, and the tab.

=head1 FIELDS

The fields in a I<rollrec> record are:

 * administrator

This is the email address for the zone's administrative user.  If it is not
set, the default from the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file will be used.

 * directory

This field contains the name of the directory in which B<rollerd> will
execute for the I<rollrec>'s zone.  If it is not specified, then the
normal B<rollerd> execution directory will be used.

 * display

This boolean field indicates whether or not the zone should be displayed by
the B<blinkenlights> program.

 * keyrec

The zone's I<keyrec> file.

 * kskphase

The zone's current KSK rollover phase.  A value of zero indicates that the
zone is not in rollover, but is in normal operation.  A numeric value of 1-7
indicates that the zone is in that phase of KSK rollover.

 * ksk_rolldate

The time at which the zone's last KSK rollover completed.  This is only used
to provide a human-readable format of the timestamp.  It is derived from the
I<ksk_rollsecs> field.

 * ksk_rollsecs

The time at which the zone's last KSK rollover completed.  This value is used
to derive the I<ksk_rolldate> field.

 * loglevel

The B<rollerd> logging level for this zone.

 * maxttl

The maximum time-to-live for the zone.  This is measured in seconds.

 * phasestart

The time-stamp of the beginning of the zone's current phase.

 * zonefile

The zone's zone file.

 * zsargs

The user-specified arguments for B<zonesigner>.  This field is set by the
B<rollctl -zsargs> command to allow modification of a zone's rollover options
without having to restart B<rollerd>.

 * zskphase

The zone's current ZSK rollover phase.  A value of zero indicates that the zone
is not in rollover, but is in normal operation.  A value of 1, 2, 3, 4
indicates that the zone is in that phase of ZSK rollover.

 * zsk_rolldate

The time at which the zone's last ZSK rollover completed.  This is only used
to provide a human-readable format of the timestamp.  It is derived from the
I<ksk_rollsecs> field.

 * zsk_rollsecs

The time at which the zone's last ZSK rollover completed.  This value is used
to derive the I<ksk_rolldate> field.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following is an example of a roll I<rollrec>:

    roll "example.com"
            zonefile        "example.signed"
            keyrec          "example.krf"
            kskphase        "1"
            zskphase        "0"
            administrator   "bob@bobbox.example.com"
            loglevel        "info"
            maxttl          "60"
            display         "1"
	    zsargs          "-zsklength 2048"
            ksk_rollsecs    "1172614842"
            ksk_rolldate    "Tue Feb 27 22:20:42 2007"
            zsk_rollsecs    "1172615087"
            zsk_rolldate    "Tue Feb 27 22:24:47 2007"
            phasestart      "Mon Feb 20 12:34:56 2007"

The following is an example of a skip I<rollrec>:

    skip "test.com"
            zonefile        "test.com.signed"
            keyrec          "test.com.krf"
            kskphase        "0"
            zskphase        "2"
            administrator   "tess@test.com"
            loglevel        "info"
            maxttl          "60"
            display         "1"
            ksk_rollsecs    "1172614800"
            ksk_rolldate    "Tue Feb 27 22:20:00 2007"
            zsk_rollsecs    "1172615070"
            zsk_rolldate    "Tue Feb 27 22:24:30 2007"
            phasestart      "Mon Feb 20 12:34:56 2007"
