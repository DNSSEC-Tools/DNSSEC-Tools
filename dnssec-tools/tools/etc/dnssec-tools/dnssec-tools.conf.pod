=head1 NAME

    dnssec-tools.conf - Configuration file for the DNSSEC-Tools programs.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file contains configuration information for the DNSSEC-Tools programs.
These configuration data are used if nothing else has been specified for a
particular program.  The B<conf.pm> module is used to parse this configuration
file.

The recognized configuration fields are described in the Configuration Records
section below.  Some configuration entries are optional and a configuration
file need not contain a complete list of entries.

A line in the configuration file contains either a comment or a configuration
entry.  Comment lines start with either a '#' character or a ';' character.
Comment lines and blank lines are ignored by the DNSSEC-Tools programs.

Configuration entries are in a I<keyword/value> format.  The keyword is a
character string that contains no whitespace.  The value is a tokenized list
of the remaining character groups, with each token separated by a single space.

True/false flags must be given a B<1> (true) or B<0> (false) value.

=head1 Configuration Records

The following records are recognized by the DNSSEC-Tools programs.
Not every DNSSEC-Tools program requires each of these records.

=over 4

=item admin-email

The email address for the DNSSEC-Tools administrator.

=item algorithm

The default encryption algorithm to be passed to B<dnssec-keygen>.

=item archivedir

The pathname to the archived-key directory.

=item default_keyrec

The default I<keyrec> filename to be used by the B<keyrec.pm> module.

=item endtime

The zone default expiration time to be passed to B<dnssec-signzone>.

=item entropy_msg

A true/false flag indicating if the B<zonesigner> command should display
a message about entropy generation.  This is primarily dependent on the
implementation of a system's random number generation.

=item genkrf

The path to the DNSSEC-Tools B<genkrf> command.

=item keyarch

The path to the DNSSEC-Tools B<keyarch> command.

=item keygen

The path to the B<dnssec-keygen> command.

=item keygen-opts

Options to pass to the B<dnssec-keygen> command.

=item kskcount

The default number of KSK keys that will be generated for each zone.

=item ksklength

The default KSK key length to be passed to B<dnssec-keygen>.

=item ksklife

The default length of time between KSK roll-overs.  This is measured in
seconds.

This value is B<only> used for key roll-over.  Keys do not have a life-time
in any other sense.

=item lifespan-max

The maximum length of time a key should be in use before it is rolled over.
This is measured in seconds.

=item lifespan-min

The minimum length of time a key should be in use before it is rolled over.
This is measured in seconds.

=item log_tz

The timezone to be used in log messages.  The value may be either 'gmt' (for
Greenwich Mean Time) or 'local' (for the host's local time.)

=item mailer-server

The mail server that will be contacted by I<dt_adminmail()>.  This is
passed to I<Mail::Send>.  The default value is B<localhost>.

=item mailer-type

The type of mailer that will be contacted by I<dt_adminmail()>.  This is
passed to I<Mail::Mailer> (by way of I<Mail::Send>.)  Any values recognized
by I<Mail::Mailer> may be used here.  The default value is B<stmp>.

=item prog-ksk1 ... prog-ksk7

A semicolon-separated list commands to run when a zone enters a particular KSK
rollover phase.  The programs can replace default rollover actions or be
executed in addition to the default actions.  The I<default> keyword must be
included if the default action should be taken.  Options and arguments may be
passed to non-default commands.

The default rollover action and requirements for user-written phase commands
are described in the documentation for B<rollerd>.

=item prog-normal

A semicolon-separated list commands to run when a zone enters the normal,
non-rollover phase.  The programs can replace default actions or be executed
in addition to the default actions.  The I<default> keyword must be included
if the default action should be taken.  Options and arguments may be passed to
non-default commands.

The default rollover action and requirements for user-written phase commands
are described in the documentation for B<rollerd>.

=item prog-zsk1 ... prog-zsk7

A semicolon-separated list commands to run when a zone enters a particular ZSK
rollover phase.  The programs can replace default rollover actions or be
executed in addition to the default actions.  The I<default> keyword must be
included if the default action should be taken.  Options and arguments may be
passed to non-default commands.

The default rollover action and requirements for user-written phase commands
are described in the documentation for B<rollerd>.

=item random

The random device generator to be passed to B<dnssec-keygen>.

=item rndc

The path to the B<rndc> command.

=item roll_loadzone

A flag indicating if B<rollerd> should have the DNS daemon reload zones.

=item roll_logfile

The log file used by B<rollerd>.

=item roll_loglevel

The default logging level used by B<rollerd>.  The valid levels are defined
and described in I<rollmgr.pm>.


=item roll_phasemsg

The default length of phase-related log messages used by B<rollerd>.  The
valid levels are "long" and "short", with "long" being the default value.

The long message length means that a phase description will be included with
some log messages.  For example, the long form of a message about ZSK rollover
phase 3 will look like this:  "ZSK phase 3 (Waiting for old zone data to
expire from caches)".

The short message length means that a phase description will not be included
with some log messages.  For example, the short form of a message about ZSK
rollover phase 3 will look like this:  "ZSK phase 3".

=item roll_sleeptime

The number of seconds B<rollerd> must wait at the end of each zone-checking
cycle.

=item roll_username

The username that B<rollerd> will be run by.  The name will be converted to
its associated uid, and the effective uid of the B<rollerd> process will be
set to that uid.  This may be given as a user name or a uid.

=item rollctl

The path to the DNSSEC-Tools B<rollctl> command.

=item savekeys

A true/false flag indicating if old keys should be moved to the
archive directory.

=item usegui

Flag to allow/disallow usage of the GUI for specifying command options.

=item zonecheck

The path to the B<named-checkzone> command.

=item zonecheck-opts

Options to pass to the B<named-checkzone> command.

=item zone_errors

The maximum number of consecutive errors a zone may have.  When This is
exceeded, B<rollerd> will mark the zone as a I<skip> zone.  If this value is
zero, or isn't included in the file, then error conditions will not affect a
zone's I<roll/skip> status.  This may be overridden by the I<maxerrors> field
in a zone's entry in a I<rollrec> file.

=item zonesign

The path to the B<dnssec-signzone> command.

=item zonesign-opts

Options to pass to the B<dnssec-signzone> command.

=item zonesigner

The path to the DNSSEC-Tools B<zonesigner> command.

=item zskcount

The default number of ZSK keys that will be generated for each zone.

=item zsklength

The default ZSK key length to be passed to B<dnssec-keygen>.

=item zsklife

The default length of time between ZSK roll-overs.  This is measured in
seconds.

This value is B<only> used for key roll-over.  Keys do not have a life-time
in any other sense.

=head1 Sample Times

Several configuration fields measure various times.  This section is a
convenient reference for several common times, as measured in seconds.

    3600	- hour
    86400	- day
    604800	- week
    2592000	- 30-day month
    15768000	- half-year
