rollerd-manyzones demo

	This directory contains tools and data for demonstrating the
	DNSSEC-Tools rollover daemon.

	This demo shows the operation of rollerd as it controls zone rollover
	for seven zones.  The zones have a wide range of rollover periods,
	some of which won't take place during the demo.

	A graphical window will appear showing the zones' rollover phases and
	in-use encryption keys.  As rollover proceeds, the phases and key
	names (as displayed in the graphical window) will change.

	A second rollrec file exists that can be used to show that rollerd can
	dynamically change between sets of zones it's managing.  This change
	will be reflected in the output of the graphical window as well as in
	log file.

To run the demo:

	- Run the demo with these commands:

		# make
		# rundemo

	  The first command will build and sign the zones and initialize
	  various state.

	  The second command starts the demo running.

	- This demo uses *very* short zone lifetimes for several zones,
	  lifetimes that are impractically short.  Several other zones have
	  much longer lifetimes, lifetimes which won't allow the zones to
	  roll during the course of the demo.

	- A graphical window is created that holds the whole of the demo
	  output.  The window in which the demo was started will have a
	  "tail -f demo.log" of rollerd's log file.

	  Occasionally, the display of the log.demo contents won't start.
	  This can be fixed by giving a control-C in that window.

	- To change rollrec files, execute this command:

		# rollctl -rollrec demo-smallset.rollrec

	All commands should be run as root.

To stop the demo:

	- Run this command:

		# rollctl -halt

	  Stopping rollerd will also stop the blinkenlights graphical program.
	  Usually.

Demo Operation:

	- The demo follows the rollover operation of three zones:

		dummy.com		woof.com
		example.com		xorn.com
		test.com		yowzah.com
					zero.com

	  The zones in the second column all have rollover periods greater
	  than a single day.

	  The zones in the first column have very short rollover periods,
	  and are the focus of the demo.  dummy.com and test.com are in
	  active rollover state; example.com is being skipped.

	  This is a very simple demo -- the rollover phase and key names are
	  what visibly change.

	- The colors of the blocks in the "Rollover Phase" column change to
	  show the change in rollover phase:

		During normal operation, the color is supposed to match the
		rest of the row.  

		During rollover, the colors start very light in phase 1 and
		progressively converge on the color of the rest of the row 
		as rollover phases move along

	- The ZSK key names are given vertically in this order:  current,
	  published, new.  When a rollover cycle completes:

		- the old "published" key becomes the new "current" key
		- the old "new" key becomes the new "published" key
		- a new "new" key is created

	  This gives the effect of the key names (very slowly) rolling up the
	  screen and disappearing.

	- The zones have different expiration times, so don't expect each
	  zone to proceed at the same rate.

	- The times given in the "Rollover Phase" columns are approximate
	  and depend on rollerd, blinkenlights, multitasking queue updates,
	  and timers timing out.

	- When the demo is first started, dummy.com and test.com are in
	  active rollover management.  example.com is not being rolled at
	  the start of the demo.  At some point, rollover for example.com
	  should be started with this command:

		# rollctl -rollzsk example.com

	  Alternatively, this can be done using a command in the "Zone
	  Control" menu:
		- Click on example.com's "stripe".  The color of the zone
		  name will change to white.
		- Select the "Roll Selected Zone" command from the "Zone
		  Control" menu.  example.com will then enter rollover and
		  its stripe will expand to match the others.

	- If you want to disable a zone's rollover, use this command:

		# rollctl -skipzone <zonename>

	  Alternatively, this can be done using a command in the "Zone
	  Control" menu:
		- Click on example.com's "stripe".  The color of the zone
		  name will change to white.
		- Select the "Skip Selected Zone" command from the "Zone
		  Control" menu.  example.com will then leave rollover and
		  its stripe will shrink and turn grey.

	- Demo phases 2 and 4 are very short-lived.  It is possible to
	  miss them if you blink at the wrong time.  Seriously.

	- If you've got all the demo files, you can run the demo by just
	  executing "rundemo".  It's probably best, however, to start
	  fresh each time by running "make" before running "rundemo".

Possible cosmetic changes, if desired:

	- If demo window is too big (or too small) adjust the size by editing
	  blinkenlights and changing the font size variable $fontsize.

	- If you don't like the descriptions in the "Rollover Phase" column,
	  they may be fixed in blinkenlights in @phasedescr.

	- If you don't like the rollover-phase colors of the "Rollover Phase"
	  column, they may be changed in blinkenlights in @phasecolors.

	- There's some extra horizontal spacing added to strings for column
	  spacing and readability.  If this is too much, then it can be
	  adjusted in blinkenlights in these places:

		- "Zone Name" column:	    zonestripe(), where $zonetxt is set.
		- "Rollover Phase" column:  @phasedescr
		- "ZSK Type" column:	    zonestripe(), in the code with the
					    "Third Column" comment.
		- "ZSK Name" column:	    zonestripe(), in the code with the
					    "Add some spacing" comment.

	- If you don't like the skipped-zone color, it may be changed in
	  blinkenlights in $skipcolor.

	- If you want the zone name to be centered, then adjust the commented
	  lines in zonestripe() near the "First column" comment.  The first
	  commented line may just be uncommented.  The second commented line
	  must be switch with a similar line such that the "-anchor => 'w'"
	  is no longer in effect.

WARNINGS:

	- This demo requires the DNSSEC-Tools scripts and modules, BIND, Perl,
	  and Perl/Tk.

	- Occasionally, blinkenlights will not go away when you stop the demo.
	  Clicking in that window and giving a ctrl-Q should kill the program.
