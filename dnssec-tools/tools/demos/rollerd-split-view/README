rollerd-split-view demo

	This directory contains tools and data for demonstrating the
	DNSSEC-Tools rollover daemon.

	This demo shows the the operation of rollerd as it controls a
	split-view zone.  There are  two views to the example.com zone:
	example.com and inside.example.com.  The views' files will be
	stored in dir.example.out and dir.example.in, respectively.

To run the demo:

	- Run the demo with these commands:

		# make basic
		# rundemo

	  The first command will build and sign the zones and initialize
	  various state.

	  The second command starts the demo running.

	- This demo uses *very* short zone lifetimes, lifetimes that
	  are impractically short.  The makefile has other demo targets;
	  consult the Makefile for other options.

	- A graphical window is created that holds the whole of the demo
	  output.  The window in which the demo was started will have a
	  "tail -f log.demo" of rollerd's log file.

	  Occasionally, the display of the log.demo contents won't start.
	  This can be fixed by giving a control-C in that window.

	All commands should be run as root.

To stop the demo:

	- Run this command:

		# rollctl -halt

	  Stopping rollerd will also stop the blinkenlights graphical program.
	  Usually.

Demo Operation:

example.com and inside.example.com.

	- The demo follows the rollover operation of two views of the zone
	  example.com.  The views are example.com and
	  inside.example.com.  This is a very simple demo -- the rollover
	  phase and key names are what visibly change.

	- The colors of the blocks in the "Rollover Phase" column change to
	  show the change in rollover phase:

		During normal operation, the color is supposed to match the
		rest of the row.  

		During rollover, the colors start very light in phase 1 and
		progressively converge on the color of the rest of the row 
		as rollover phases move along

	- The ZSK signing set names are given vertically in this order:
	  current, published, new.  When a rollover cycle completes:

		- the old "published" set becomes the new "current" set
		- the old "new" set becomes the new "published" set
		- a new "new" set is created

	  This gives the effect of the signing set names slowly rolling up
	  the screen and disappearing.

	- The zones have different expiration times, so don't expect each
	  zone to proceed at the same rate.

	- The times given in the "Rollover Phase" columns are approximate
	  and depend on rollerd, blinkenlights, multitasking queue updates,
	  and timers timing out.

	- When the demo is first started, both views are in active rollover
	  management.

	- If you want to disable a zone's rollover, use this command:

		# rollctl -skipzone <zonename>

	- Demo phases 2 and 4 are very short-lived.  It is possible to
	  miss them if you blink at the wrong time.  Seriously.

	- If you've got all the demo files, you can run the demo by just
	  executing "rundemo".  It's probably best, however, to start
	  fresh each time by running "make basic" before running "rundemo".

Possible cosmetic changes, if desired:

	- If demo window is too big (or too small) adjust the size by editing
	  blinkenlights and changing the font size variable $fontsize.

	- If you don't like the descriptions in the "Rollover Phase" column,
	  they may be fixed in blinkenlights in @phasedescr.

	- If you don't like the rollover-phase colors of the "Rollover Phase"
	  column, they may be changed in blinkenlights in @phasecolors.

	- There's some extra horizontal spacing added to strings for column
	  spacing and readability.  If this is too much, then it can be
	  adjusted in blinkenlights in these places:

		- "Zone Name" column:	    zonestripe(), where $zonetxt is set.
		- "Rollover Phase" column:  @phasedescr
		- "ZSK Type" column:	    zonestripe(), in the code with the
					    "Third Column" comment.
		- "ZSK Name" column:	    zonestripe(), in the code with the
					    "Add some spacing" comment.

	- If you don't like the skipped-zone color, it may be changed in
	  blinkenlights in $skipcolor.

	- If you want the zone name to be centered, then adjust the commented
	  lines in zonestripe() near the "First column" comment.  The first
	  commented line may just be uncommented.  The second commented line
	  must be switch with a similar line such that the "-anchor => 'w'"
	  is no longer in effect.

WARNINGS:

	- This demo requires the DNSSEC-Tools scripts and modules, BIND, Perl,
	  and Perl/Tk.

	- Occasionally, blinkenlights will not go away when you stop the demo.
	  Clicking in that window and giving a ctrl-Q should kill the program.
