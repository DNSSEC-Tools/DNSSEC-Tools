rollerd-vastzones demo

	This directory contains tools and data for demonstrating the
	DNSSEC-Tools rollover daemon using a very large number of zones.

	This demo shows the basic operation of rollerd as it controls zone
	rollover for a large number of zones.  The makefile has three pre-
	defined settings for different numbers of zones:  10, 50, and 200.
	A graphical window will appear for the "lights" GUI.  It will give
	an short summary of the rollover status for the zones being managed
	in the demo.  As rollover proceeds, the counts of the zones in the
	various rollover phases will change.

To run the demo:

	- Run the demo with these commands:

		# make
		# rundemo

	  The first command will build and sign the 50 zones and initialize
	  various state data.

	  The second command starts the demo running.

	- This demo uses *very* short zone lifetimes -- 30 to 60 seconds.
	  These lifetimes are impractically short and are only used for
	  the sake of this demo.  The makefile has these demo targets:

		target		zone count
		ten		10 zones
		fifty		50 zones	(default setting)
		two-hundred	200 zones

	  The "makezones" command can be used to create as many demo
	  zones as desired.

	- Giving the -autods option to rundemo *may* automatically
	  move zones from KSK phase 6 to KSK phase 7 without requiring
	  user input.  However, sometimes this doesn't work.

	- Another way to automatically move from zones from KSK phase 6
	  to KSK phase 7 is to use the autods command.  This command can
	  be run in another window.

To stop the demo:

	- Run this command:

		# rollctl -halt

	  Stopping rollerd will not stop the lights graphical program.

Demo Operation:

	- As of now, blinkenlights does not work well with a large number
	  of zones.  bubbles works somewhat, but not completely.  It is
	  hoped that this will be fixed soon.

	- Consult the man page for lights to decipher the gui display.
	  Basically though, it means:

		red	count of zones in KSK phase 6
		yellow	count of zones in KSK non-phase 6 rollover /
			count of zones in ZSK
		green	count of zones not in rollover

WARNINGS:

	- This demo requires the DNSSEC-Tools scripts and modules, BIND, Perl,
	  and Perl/Tk.
