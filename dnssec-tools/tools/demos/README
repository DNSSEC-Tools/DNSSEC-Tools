This directory contains tools and data for demonstrating the DNSSEC-Tools
programs.  The tools and data files are divided into subdirectories by demo.
The demos are described below.


For all demos, as rollover proceeds, the phases and key names (as displayed in
the graphical window) will change.

rollerd-basic

	This demo shows the basic operation of rollerd as it controls zone
	rollover for two zones.  There are two zones:  example.com and
	test.com.  example.com starts as a rolling zone; test.com starts
	as a skipped zone.

rollerd-manyzones

	This demo shows the basic operation of rollerd as it controls zone
	rollover for seven zones.  Three zones have lifetimes that allow very
	fast rollover, though one of them starts the demo in the "skipped"
	state.  The other four zones have very long rollover times.

rollerd-subdirs

	This demo shows the basic operation of rollerd as it controls zone
	rollover for three zones.  There are three zones:  dummy.com,
	example.com, and test.com.  example.com starts as a skipped zone;
	dummy.com and test.com start as skipped zones.  In addition, the
	files for dummy.com and example.com are kept in separate
	subdirectories.
