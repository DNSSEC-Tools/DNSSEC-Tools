basic-rollerd

	This demo shows the basic operation of rollerd as it controls zone
	rollover for three zones.  A graphical window will appear showing the
	zones' rollover phases and in-use encryption keys.  As rollover
	proceeds, the phases and key names (as displayed in the graphical
	window) will change.
