This directory contains tools and data for demonstrating the DNSSEC-Tools
programs.  The tools and data files are divided into subdirectories by demo.
The demos are described below.


rollerd-basic

	This demo shows the basic operation of rollerd as it controls zone
	rollover for three zones.  A graphical window will appear showing the
	zones' rollover phases and in-use encryption keys.  As rollover
	proceeds, the phases and key names (as displayed in the graphical
	window) will change.

rollerd-manyzones

	This demo shows the basic operation of rollerd as it controls zone
	rollover for seven zones.  Three zones have lifetimes that allow very
	fast rollover, though one of them starts the demo in the "skipped"
	state.  The other four zones have very long rollover times.

	A graphical window will appear showing the zones' rollover phases and
	in-use encryption keys.  As rollover proceeds, the phases and key
	names (as displayed in the graphical window) will change.
