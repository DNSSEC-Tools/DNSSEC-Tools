dtrealms-basic demo

	This directory contains tools and data for demonstrating the
	DNSSEC-Tools realms daemon.

	This demo shows the basic operation of dtrealms as it controls two
	instances of rollerd.  A graphical window will appear showing
	the realms' status, and the count of zones in normal state, ZSK
	rollover, KSK rollover, and KSK phase 6 wait.  As rollover proceeds
	in the two realms, the phase counts will change.  A graphical
	interface will also be displayed for each realm, and they will
	give more details about the particular zone rollovers.

To run the demo:

	- Run the demo with these commands:

		# make basic
		# rundemo

	  The first command will build the realms and their required
	  directories, and sign the zones and initialize various state.

	  The second command starts the demo running.

	- This demo uses *very* short zone lifetimes, lifetimes that
	  are impractically short.

	- A graphical window is created that holds the whole of the demo
	  output.  The window in which the demo was started will have a
	  "tail -f log.demo" of dtrealms's log file.

To stop the demo:

	- Run this command:

		# realmctl -halt

	  Stopping dtrealms will also stop the grandvizier and blinkenlights
	  graphical programs.  Usually.
