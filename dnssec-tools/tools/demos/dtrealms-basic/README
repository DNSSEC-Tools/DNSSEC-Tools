dtrealms-basic demo

	This directory contains tools and data for demonstrating the
	DNSSEC-Tools realms daemon.

	This demo shows the basic operation of dtrealms as it controls two
	instances of rollerd.  A graphical window will appear showing
	the realms' status, and the count of zones in normal state, ZSK
	rollover, KSK rollover, and KSK phase 6 wait.  As rollover proceeds
	in the two realms, the phase counts will change.  A graphical
	interface will also be displayed for each realm, and they will
	give more details about the particular zone rollovers.

To run the demo:

	- Run the demo with these commands:

		# make basic
		# rundemo

	  The first command will build the realms and their required
	  directories, and sign the zones and initialize various state.

	  The second command starts the demo running.

	- This demo uses *very* short zone lifetimes, lifetimes that
	  are impractically short.

	- A graphical window is created that holds the whole of the demo
	  output.  The window in which the demo was started will have a
	  "tail -f log.demo" of dtrealms's log file.

POTENTIAL DEMO PROBLEM:

	Due to a realms configuration requirement colliding with an operating
	system limitation, it's very possible the "make basic" demo will not
	work correctly.  In this case, you can try running the demo with
	these commands:

		# make tmpdemo
		# cd /tmp/dtrealms-basic-demo
		# rundemo
	This should solve the problem.

To stop the demo:

	- Run this command:

		# realmctl -halt

	  Stopping dtrealms will also stop the grandvizier and blinkenlights
	  graphical programs.  Usually.


Files:
	Makefile		Makefile to control demo execution.
	README			This file.
	mkconffiles		Creates the required key archive directory.
	phaser			Initializes some data at demo start.
	rundemo			Executes demo.

	Pristine copies of the config files, realm file, and zone files
	are in the savefiles directory.
