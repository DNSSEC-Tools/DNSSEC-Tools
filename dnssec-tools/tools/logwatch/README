This directory contains configuration files and scripts for logwatch
to manage log files for BIND security function.

First, you need to obtain and install logwatch. Logwatch is available from
http://www2.logwatch.org:81/tabs/download

The current version as of this writing is 6.0.2 (Apr 25, 2005).

When logwatch is installed, you need to install the files in this tree.
Assumptions:

-- log files for BIND are located in /var/log and are called dnssec 
   and resolver. The location and name of these files are configured
   in your BIND config file, often called named.conf.

-- logwatch is installed in $LOGWATCH_DIR (by default this would be
   /etc/log.d).

You may edit the logwatch config files and scripts to change these names
if you have used something else.

Copy the files in ./conf/logfiles, ./conf/services, and ./scripts/services
into the same directory structure in $LOGWATCH_DIR. For example, 

cp ./conf/logfiles/* /etc/log.d/conf/logfiles/.
cp ./conf/services/* /etc/log.d/conf/services/.
cp ./scripts/services/* /etc/log.d/scripts/services/.

This all that is necessary to get logwatch to monitor your BIND security
logfiles. Now run logwatch, and see the DNSSEC and RESOLVER sections for
output.
