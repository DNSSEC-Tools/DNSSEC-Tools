dnsval.py is a Python wrapper module around the libval validator
library. This code was contributed by Bob Novas, Shinkuro, Inc. 

Wrapper functions are provided for the following basic validator
functions: 
    val_context_create()
    val_free_context()
    val_resolve_and_check()
    val_free_result_chain()
    val_context_setqflags()
    val_istrusted()
    val_isvalidated()
    val_does_not_exist()
    p_val_status()
    p_ac_status()
    val_log_add_optarg()
    

There is no support, currently, for any of the libval asynchronous
resolution functions.


The test program performs some basic tests of the wrappers mapping with
the currently installed validator library. It may be run as follows:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path/to/validator/libs> python test_dnsval.py
