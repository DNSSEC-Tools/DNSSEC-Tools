This directory contains tools for use in managing DNSSEC environments.
Brief descriptions of these tools are given below.

	clean-keyrec	Cleans unreferenced key keyrecs from keyrec files.

	expchk		Checks a keyrec file for expired zones.

	fixkrf		Fixes a keyrec file whose encryption keys have been
			moved since the keyrecs have been written.

	keyrec-check	Verifies the validity of a keyrec file.

	lskrf		Lists the contents of a keyrec file.

	zonesigner	Generates a set of keys for a zone and signs the zone
			with those keys.  This combines the functionality of
			dnssec-keygen and dnssec-signzone, recording relevant
			information in a keyrec file.

Keyrec files are documented in the source for dnssec-tools/keyrec.pm.
