			     DNSSEC-Tools
			Is your domain secure?

This directory contains tools for use in managing DNSSEC environments.
Brief descriptions of these tools are given below.

	clean-keyrec	Cleans unreferenced key keyrecs from keyrec files.

	dtconfchk	Checks a DNSSEC-Tools configuration file for validity.

	dtdefs		Display DNSSEC-Tools defaults.

	dtinitconf	Create a new DNSSEC-Tools configuration file from
			command-line options and defaults.

	expchk		Checks a keyrec file for expired zones.

	fixkrf		Fixes a keyrec file whose encryption keys have been
			moved since the keyrecs have been written.

	genkrf		Generates a keyrec file using existing key signing
			key and/or zone signing keys.

	keyrec-check	Verifies the validity of a keyrec file.

	lskrf		Lists the contents of a keyrec file.

	rollctl		Control program for the roll-over daemon.

	rrchk		Verifies the validity of a rollrec file.

	rrinit		Generates rollrec records for domains.

	tachk		Reads a trusted-keys block from a named.conf file and
			performs queries to see if the configured trust
			anchors are still published by the zones.
			NOTE: This script addtionally requires Net::DNS::SEC

	timetrans	Converts time units (weeks, days, etc.) into the
			appropriate number of seconds.  Intended for use in
			calculating the end-time argument used by zonesigner
			and dnssec-signzone.

	zonesigner	Generates a set of keys for a zone and signs the zone
			with those keys.  This combines the functionality of
			dnssec-keygen and dnssec-signzone, recording relevant
			information in a keyrec file.



Keyrec files are documented in the source for .../modules/keyrec.pm and in
.../modules/file-keyrec.

The DNSSEC-Tools configuration file is documented in 
.../etc/dnssec/dnssec-tools.conf.pm.
