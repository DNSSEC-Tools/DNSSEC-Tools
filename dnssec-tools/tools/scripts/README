			     DNSSEC-Tools
			Is your domain secure?

This directory contains tools for use in managing DNSSEC environments.
Brief descriptions of these tools are given below.

	blinkenlights	Gives a complex graphical display of rollerd activity
			and allows some control of zones.

	bubbles		Gives a simple graphical display of rollerd activity.

	cleanarch	Cleans key archives.

	cleankrf	Cleans unreferenced key keyrecs from keyrec files.

	dtck            Runs validation checks on all the data files used by
			the DNSSEC-Tools scripts.

	dtconf		Displays the key/value pairs in a DNSSEC-Tools
			configuration file.

	dtconfchk	Checks a DNSSEC-Tools configuration file for validity.

	dtdefs		Display DNSSEC-Tools defaults.

	dtinitconf	Create a new DNSSEC-Tools configuration file from
			command-line options and defaults.

	dtrealms	The realms manager daemon.

	dtreqmods	Checks for Perl modules required by DNSSEC-Tools.

	dtupdkrf	Updates an old-format keyrec file to the current
			format.  The keyrec file format changes rarely,
			so this is not commonly needed.

	expchk		Checks a keyrec file for expired zones.

	fixkrf		Fixes a keyrec file whose encryption keys have been
			moved since the keyrecs have been written.

	genkrf		Generates a keyrec file using existing key signing
			key and/or zone signing keys.

	getdnskeys      Fetch, compare and remember a list of DNSKEYs
			from DNS zones

	grandvizier	Graphic display of rollover environments.

	keyarch		Archives obsolete keys.

	keymod		Modifies key generation parameters in a keyrec file.

	krfcheck	Verifies the validity of a keyrec file.

	lights		Gives a very simple GUI summary of zone rollover states.

	lskrf		Lists the contents of a keyrec file.

	lsrealm		Lists the contents of a realms file.

	lsroll		Lists the contents of a rollrec file.

	realmchk	Verifies the validity of a realms file.

	realmctl	Control program for the dtrealms daemon.

	realminit	Generates realms records for a realm.

	rollctl		Control program for the rollover daemon.

	rollerd		The rollover daemon.

	rollchk		Verifies the validity of a rollrec file.

	rollinit	Generates rollrec records for domains.

	rolllog		Adds a log record to the rollover daemon's log file.

	rollrec-editor	GUI editor for managing rollrecs in rollrec files.

	rollset		Modifies the rollrec records in a rollrec file.

	signset-editor	GUI editor for managing signing sets in keyrec files.

	tachk		Reads a trusted-keys block from a named.conf file and
			performs queries to see if the configured trust
			anchors are still published by the zones.
			NOTE: This script additionally requires Net::DNS::SEC.

	timetrans	Converts time units (weeks, days, etc.) into the
			appropriate number of seconds.  Intended for use in
			calculating the end-time argument used by zonesigner
			and dnssec-signzone.

	zonesigner	Generates a set of keys for a zone and signs the zone
			with those keys.  This combines the functionality of
			dnssec-keygen and dnssec-signzone, recording relevant
			information in a keyrec file.



Keyrec files are documented in the source for .../modules/keyrec.pm and in
.../modules/file-keyrec.

The DNSSEC-Tools configuration file is documented in 
.../etc/dnssec/dnssec-tools.conf.pm.
