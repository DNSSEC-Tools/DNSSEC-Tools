=head1 NAME

getname - command-line test program for the I<val_getnameinfo()> function 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   getname [options] address 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility is a command-line wrapper around the I<val_getnameinfo()>
function.  It invokes the I<val_getnameinfo()> function with the given
command-line arguments and displays the returned host and service information
for the given node name, with a validation status value.

The exit status for this program is 1 if the answer received is trusted, 2 if
the answer received is validated, and -1 for an error.  The program returns 0 if 
no validation was performed or if the result was neither trusted nor validated. 
The trusted and validated status values are obtained using the I<val_istrusted()> 
and I<val_isvalidated()> functions from I<libval(3)>.
