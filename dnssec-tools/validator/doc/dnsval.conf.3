.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Applications can use local policy to influence the validation outcome.
Examples of local policy elements include trust anchors for different zones
and untrusted algorithms for cryptographic keys and hashes.  Local policy
may vary for different applications and operating scenarios.
.PP
The \fI\fIval_add_valpolicy()\fI\fR function can be used to dynamically add a new policy
for a given context (the policies are not added persistently to the system
configuration). The policy_definition field contains an implementation-specific
definition of the validator policy to be added. For the libval library this is
represented by the libval_policy_definition_t structure, which contains four
fields: \fIkeyword\fR, \fIzone\fR and \fIvalue\fR arguments are
identical to \fIkeyword\fR, \fIzone\fR and \fIadditional-data\fR defined below for
\&\fBdnsval.conf\fR.  \fIttl\fR specifies the duration in seconds for which the
policy is kept in effect.  A \fItt\fR value of \fB\-1\fR adds to policy to the context
indefinitely.  A handle to the newly added policy is returned in \fI*pol\fR.
This structure is opaque to the applications; applications must not modify the
contents of the memory returned in \fI*pol\fR.
.PP
Applications may also revoke the effects of a newly added policy, \fIpol\fR,
before the expiry of its timeout interval using the
\&\fI\fIval_remove_valpolicy()\fI\fR policy.
.PP
The validator library reads configuration information from three separate
files, \fBresolv.conf\fR, \fBroot.hints\fR, and \fBdnsval.conf\fR.
.IP "resolv.conf" 4
.IX Item "resolv.conf"
The \fInameserver\fR and \fIsearch\fR options are supported in the \fBresolv.conf\fR file.
.Sp
This \fInameserver\fR option is used to specify the \s-1IP\s0 address of the name server to which
queries must be sent by default.  For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    nameserver 10.0.0.1
.Ve
.Sp
This \fIsearch\fR option is used to specify the search path for issuing queries.
For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    search test.dnssec-tools.org dnssec-tools.org
.Ve
.Sp
The \fIforward\fR option is used to redirect queries for names that match a given zone name
to the provided name server.  For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    forward 76.216.12.217 test.dnssec-tools.org
.Ve
.Sp
If the \fBresolv.conf\fR file contains no name servers, the validator
tries to recursively answer the query using information present
in \fBroot.hints\fR.
.IP "root.hints" 4
.IX Item "root.hints"
The \fBroot.hints\fR file contains bootstrapping information for the
resolver while it attempts to recursively answer queries.  The contents of
this file may be generated by the following command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    dig @e.root-servers.net . ns > root.hints
.Ve
.IP "dnsval.conf" 4
.IX Item "dnsval.conf"
The \fBdnsval.conf\fR file contains the validator policy.  It consists of
a sequence of the following \*(L"policy\-fragments\*(R":
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    <label> <keyword> <additional-data>;
.Ve
.Sp
Policies are identified by simple text strings called
labels, which must be unique within the configuration system.  For example,
\&\*(L"browser\*(R" could be used as the label that defines the validator policy for all
web-browsers in a system.  A label value of \*(L":\*(R" identifies the default policy,
the policy that is used when a \s-1NULL\s0 context is specified as the \fIctx\fR
parameter for interfaces listed in \fI\fIlibval\fI\|(3)\fR,
\&\fI\fIval_getaddrinfo\fI\|(3)\fR, and \fI\fIval_gethostbyname\fI\|(3)\fR.  The default policy must be 
unique within the configuration system.
.Sp
\&\fIkeyword\fR specifies the policy component within the
policy fragment.  The format of \fIadditional-data\fR depends on the
keyword specified.
.Sp
If multiple policy fragments are defined for the same label and keyword
combination then the first definition in the file is used.
.Sp
The following keywords are defined for \fBdnsval.conf\fR:
.RS 4
.IP "trust-anchor" 4

.IP "zone-security-expectation" 4
.IX Item "zone-security-expectation"
For the \*(L"zone\-security\-expectation\*(R" attribute additional-data
is a sequence of  &lt;domain name,value&gt; tuples representing the
security expectation for names in that domain, where value can be one of the following:
.RS 4

.IX Item "ignore"
Ignore \s-1DNSSEC\s0 validation for names under this domain. 
.IP "validate" 4

.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
This zone-security-expectation \s-1DNSSEC\s0 validator policy construct makes it possible to define
various islands of trust for DNSSEC-enabled zones and to
ignore or validate data from selected zones. The default zone
security expectation for a domain is \*(L"validate\*(R".
In the following example, for \s-1DNSSEC\s0 validator contexts created with a \s-1DNSSEC\s0 validator policy label of \*(L"browser\*(R",
the \s-1DNSSEC\s0 validation is only performed for names
under the example.com domain; names under the somebogus.org domain are always
considered to be untrusted and \s-1DNSSEC\s0 validation for all other domain names is ignored.

the provably insecure condition is treated as valid for all domains except the net domain,
where this condition is treated as invalid.

.IP "clock-skew" 4
.IX Item "clock-skew"
For the \*(L"clock\-skew\*(R" attribute additional-data is a sequence of the
domain name and the number of seconds of clock-skew acceptable for signatures
on names in that domain. A clock skew value of \-1 has the effect of turning off
inception and expiration time checks on signatures from that domain. The default clock
skew is 0.
In the following example, for \s-1DNSSEC\s0 validator contexts created with the \*(L"mta\*(R" label, signature
inception and expiration checks are disabled for all names under the example.com domain.

.IX Item "nsec3-max-iter [only if LIBVAL_NSEC3 is enabled]"
Specifies the maximum number of iterations allowable while computing
the \s-1NSEC3\s0 hash for a zone.  A value of \-1 does not place a maximum limit on
the number of iterations.  This is also the default setting for a zone.
.IP "dlv-trust-points [only if \s-1LIBVAL_DLV\s0 is enabled]" 4
.IX Item "dlv-trust-points [only if LIBVAL_DLV is enabled]"
Specifies the \s-1DLV\s0 tree for the target zone. In the following example, libval will use
the \s-1DLV\s0 registry defined at dlv.isc.org. for all queries under the root that do not
give us a trustworthy answer using the normal \s-1DNSSEC\s0 mechanism, and are not 
marked as trusted or untrusted zones in the dnsval.conf zone-security-expectation statement.
.Sp

In order for \s-1DLV\s0 to be used in the above example, there must be a 
trust-anchor policy defined for the dlv.isc.org zone, with the
zone-security-expectation policy for dlv.isc.org set to validate.
.RE
.RS 4

Apart from zone-specific configuration options, it is also possible to

the value returned from the \fIval_istrusted()\fR function (see \fB\f(BIlibval\fB\|(3)\fR) 
is greater than one.
.IP "edns0\-size" 4
.IX Item "edns0-size"
This option can be used for specifying the \s-1EDNS0\s0 window size.
.IP "env-policy" 4
.IX Item "env-policy"
This option allows the administrator of the dnsval.conf to control whether 
libval uses user-specified values in environmental variables while determining 
libval policy and log targets. See the section below on overriding
dnsval.conf policies for additional details on this option.
.IP "app-policy" 4
.IX Item "app-policy"
This option allows the administrator of the dnsval.conf file to control
whether libval will automatically look for a validation policy with a label
equal to the application name in \fBdnsval.conf\fR. See the section below on 
overriding dnsval.conf policies for additional details on this option.
.IP "log" 4

.SH "OVERRIDING resolv.conf POLICIES"
.IX Header "OVERRIDING resolv.conf POLICIES"
libval first looks at resolver options present in the resolv.conf file 
specfied at the time of running configure. If this file is absent, libval
looks at /etc/resolv.conf file for resolver options.
.PP
This allows users with a simple way of overriding resolver policies. The
system-specific resolv.conf can remain unchanged, while any additional policies
that may have to be specified for libval can be used in the configure-supplied
resolv.conf file.
.SH "OVERRIDING dnsval.conf POLICIES"
.IX Header "OVERRIDING dnsval.conf POLICIES"
libval provides three ways for tailoring dnsval.conf policies for a given environment.
.IP "Multiple include files" 4
.IX Item "Multiple include files"
libval allows additional dnsval.conf files to be included with a given dnsval.conf file.
The option is specified as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    include /path/to/override/file/dnsval.conf
.Ve
.Sp
The files are read in breadth\-first. The policies are evaluated in a manner that gives the last-defined
policy more precedence over earlier ones. Therefore, an administrator may supply a dnsval.conf
with default policies including another file from the user's home directory. The included file may be used
for overriding policies specified in the base dnsval.conf file.
.IP "Application-name policies" 4
.IX Item "Application-name policies"
If the app-policy global option is not disabled, libval automatically looks for 
a policy in dnsval.conf with a label value constructed from the name of the application.
For example, dnsval.conf may be defined with validator policies for the foo label. 
The foo application, when run, will use the policy defined against the foo label during
its validation operation.
.IP "Policies through environment" 4
.IX Item "Policies through environment"
If the env-policy global option is not disabled, libval looks at the \s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0
and \s-1VAL_LOG_TARGET\s0 environmental variables in order to determine the validator policy 
label and log target.
.IP "Validator Label Precendence" 4
.IX Item "Validator Label Precendence"
There are effectively four different types of polic-labels that can be applied by libval:
application-name policies, policies through \s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0, and labels specified by the 
application (either \s-1NULL\s0 or non\-NULL). The precedence of applying these labels is defined
with the following rules:
.Sp
1. If env-policy is \*(L"override\*(R", use the label specified in the \s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0 env 
variable (if defined).  
.Sp
2. If env-policy is \*(L"enable\*(R" and the policy specified by the application  is \s-1NULL\s0, 
use the label specified in the \s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0 env variable (if defined).  
.Sp
3. if app-policy is \*(L"override\*(R", use the label generated from the application name.
If this policy label does not exist in the configuration system, use the default policy.
.Sp
4. if app-policy is \*(L"enable\*(R" and the policy specified by the application is \s-1NULL\s0, 
use the label generated from the application name.
.Sp
5. If policy specified by the application is not \s-1NULL\s0, use this label. 
.Sp
6. Use default policy
.Sp
The following use-cases can therefore be defined
.RS 4
.IP "locked-down system with single policy" 4
.IX Item "locked-down system with single policy"
An administrator that wants to (and is able to) lock down a system to a particular 
validator policy, must set the env-policy and app-policy global options to disable.
This also requires that administrators are able to lock down the system to specific 
applications and that these applications are not written in a way that would allow
them to specify non-NULL policy labels during context creation. (see val_create_context
in \fIlibval\fR\|(3)).
.IP "locked-down system with app-specific policies" 4
.IX Item "locked-down system with app-specific policies"
An administrator that wants to (and is able to) lock down a system to a particular
dnsval.conf file, but wishes to use different policies for different applications must
set the app-policy to override and the env-policy to disable. The administrator must also
define policies for various application names in dnval.conf; for applications that don't have
a policy with a label corresponding to its name, the default policy is used.
.Sp
The administrator may set the app-policy to enable if non-NULL policies specified
by the application during validator context creation is deemed acceptable.
.IP "User controlled" 4
.IX Item "User controlled"
An administrator can set env-policy to override to give the user complete control over
which policy label is used during validation. The validation policy is read through the
\&\s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0 environment variable.
.Sp
If \s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0 is specified globally for the system, the administrator may instead 
choose the env-policy global option to be enable instead of override. In this case, 
the label given in \s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0 is used only when the policy specified by the
application is non\-NULL.
.Sp
The label in \s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0 is used only if it is defined. If this value is \s-1NULL\s0, libval
will read other policy labels as guided by the precedence rules listed above.
