.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Applications can use local policy to influence the validation outcome.
Examples of local policy elements include trust anchors for different zones
and untrusted algorithms for cryptographic keys and hashes.  Local policy
may vary for different applications and operating scenarios.
.PP
The \fI\fIval_add_valpolicy()\fI\fR function can be used to dynamically add a new policy
for a given context (the policies are not added persistently to the system
configuration). The policy_definition field contains an implementation-specific
definition of the validator policy to be added. For the libval library this is
represented by the libval_policy_definition_t structure, which contains four
fields: \fIkeyword\fR, \fIzone\fR and \fIvalue\fR arguments are
identical to \fIkeyword\fR, \fIzone\fR and \fIadditional-data\fR defined below for
\&\fBdnsval.conf\fR.  \fIttl\fR specifies the duration in seconds for which the
policy is kept in effect.  A \fItt\fR value of \fB\-1\fR adds to policy to the context
indefinitely.  A handle to the newly added policy is returned in \fI*pol\fR.
This structure is opaque to the applications; applications must not modify the
contents of the memory returned in \fI*pol\fR.
.PP
Applications may also revoke the effects of a newly added policy, \fIpol\fR,
before the expiry of its timeout interval using the
\&\fI\fIval_remove_valpolicy()\fI\fR policy.
.PP
The validator library reads configuration information from three separate
files, \fBresolv.conf\fR, \fBroot.hints\fR, and \fBdnsval.conf\fR.
.IP "resolv.conf" 4
.IX Item "resolv.conf"
The \fInameserver\fR and \fIsearch\fR options are supported in the \fBresolv.conf\fR file.
.Sp
This \fInameserver\fR option is used to specify the \s-1IP\s0 address of the name server to which
queries must be sent by default.  For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    nameserver 10.0.0.1
.Ve
.Sp
This \fIsearch\fR option is used to specify the search path for issuing queries.
For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    search test.dnssec\-tools.org dnssec\-tools.org
.Ve
.Sp
The \fIforward\fR option is used to redirect queries for names that match a given zone name
to the provided name server.  For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    forward 76.216.12.217 test.dnssec\-tools.org
.Ve
.Sp
If the \fBresolv.conf\fR file contains no name servers, the validator
tries to recursively answer the query using information present
in \fBroot.hints\fR.
.IP "root.hints" 4
.IX Item "root.hints"
The \fBroot.hints\fR file contains bootstrapping information for the
resolver while it attempts to recursively answer queries.  The contents of
this file may be generated by the following command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    dig @e.root\-servers.net . ns > root.hints
.Ve
.IP "dnsval.conf" 4
.IX Item "dnsval.conf"
The \fBdnsval.conf\fR file contains the validator policy.  It consists of
a sequence of the following \*(L"policy-fragments\*(R":
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    <label> <keyword> <additional\-data>;
.Ve
.Sp
Policies are identified by simple text strings called
labels, which must be unique within the configuration system.  For example,
\&\*(L"browser\*(R" could be used as the label that defines the validator policy for all
web-browsers in a system.  A label value of \*(L":\*(R" identifies the default policy,
the policy that is used when a \s-1NULL\s0 context is specified as the \fIctx\fR
parameter for interfaces listed in \fI\fIlibval\fI\|(3)\fR,
\&\fI\fIval_getaddrinfo\fI\|(3)\fR, and \fI\fIval_gethostbyname\fI\|(3)\fR.  The default policy must be 
unique within the configuration system.
.Sp
\&\fIkeyword\fR specifies the policy component within the
policy fragment.  The format of \fIadditional-data\fR depends on the
keyword specified.
.Sp
If multiple policy fragments are defined for the same label and keyword
combination then the first definition in the file is used.
.Sp
The following keywords are defined for \fBdnsval.conf\fR:
.RS 4
.IP "trust-anchor" 4
.IX Item "trust-anchor"
For the \*(L"trust-anchor\*(R" attribute additional-data is a sequence of
ordered pairs, each consisting of the zone name and 
the \s-1RDATA\s0 portion for the trust anchor with an optional prefix. 
Trust anchors may be either \s-1DNSKEY\s0 or \s-1DS\s0 records, the prefix in 
the \s-1RDATA\s0 is use to indicate what type of record it is. 
\&\s-1DNSKEY\s0 is assumed if no prefix is specified.

.IX Item "zone-security-expectation"
For the \*(L"zone-security-expectation\*(R" attribute additional-data

the security expectation for names in that domain, where value 
can be one of the following:

This zone-security-expectation \s-1DNSSEC\s0 validator policy construct 
makes it possible to define various islands of trust for 
DNSSEC-enabled zones and to ignore or validate data from selected 
zones. The default zone security expectation for a domain is 
\&\*(L"validate\*(R".  In the following example, for \s-1DNSSEC\s0 validator 
contexts created with a \s-1DNSSEC\s0 validator policy label of \*(L"browser\*(R",
the \s-1DNSSEC\s0 validation is only performed for names under the 
example.com domain; names under the somebogus.org domain are always

inception and expiration time checks on signatures from that domain. The default clock
skew is 0.
In the following example, for \s-1DNSSEC\s0 validator contexts created with the \*(L"mta\*(R" label, signature
inception and expiration checks are disabled for all names under the example.com domain.

The following \s-1EDNS0\s0 sizes are tried by default: 4096, 1492, 512
The \*(L"edns0\-size\*(R" policy knob can be used to change the
largest \s-1EDNS0\s0 size that is attempted.
.IP "env-policy" 4
.IX Item "env-policy"
This option allows the administrator of the dnsval.conf to control whether 
libval uses user-specified values in environmental variables while determining 
libval policy and log targets. See the section below on overriding
dnsval.conf policies for additional details on this option.
.IP "app-policy" 4
.IX Item "app-policy"
This option allows the administrator of the dnsval.conf file to control
whether libval will automatically look for a validation policy with a label
equal to the application name in \fBdnsval.conf\fR. See the section below on 
overriding dnsval.conf policies for additional details on this option.
.IP "closest-ta-only" 4
.IX Item "closest-ta-only"
The default validation behavior is to look for any authentication chain that
validates successfully. Thus if there are trust anchors for example.com and
test.example.com the validator will return success if the authentication chain
can be anchored to the example.com trust anchor, even if the trust anchor for
test.example.com does not match. In cases where this is not desirable, the
closest-ta-only option can be used.

If this option is set to \fByes\fR then the validation algorithm terminates at
the closest matching \s-1TA\s0.

1. If env-policy is \*(L"override\*(R", use the label specified in the \s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0 env 
variable (if defined).
.Sp
2. If env-policy is \*(L"enable\*(R" and the policy specified by the application  is \s-1NULL\s0, 
use the label specified in the \s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0 env variable (if defined).

4. if app-policy is \*(L"enable\*(R" and the policy specified by the application is \s-1NULL\s0, 
use the label generated from the application name.

which policy label is used during validation. The validation policy is read through the
\&\s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0 environment variable.
.Sp
If \s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0 is specified globally for the system, the administrator may instead 
choose the env-policy global option to be enable instead of override. In this case, 
the label given in \s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0 is used only when the policy specified by the
application is non-NULL.
.Sp
The label in \s-1VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL\s0 is used only if it is defined. If this value is \s-1NULL\s0, libval
will read other policy labels as guided by the precedence rules listed above.
