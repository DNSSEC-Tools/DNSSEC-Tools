=head1 DESCRIPTION

The I<val_resolve_and_check()> function queries a set of name servers for
the I<<domain_name_n, type, class>> tuple and to verifies and validates the
response.  Verification involves checking the RRSIGs, and validation is
verification of an authentication chain from a configured trust anchor.
The I<domain_name_n> parameter is the queried name in DNS wire format.
The conversion from host format to DNS wire format can be done using the
I<ns_name_pton()> function exported by the I<libsres(3)> library.

The I<flags> parameter can be used to control the results of validation.
Two values, which may be ORed together, are currently defined for this field.
B<VAL_QUERY_DONT_VALIDATE> causes the validator to disable validation for this
query.  B<VAL_QUERY_NO_DLV> causes the validator to disable DLV processing for
this query.  The second flag is only available if the I<libval(3)> library has
been compiled with DLV support.

The first parameter to I<val_resolve_and_check()> is the validator context.
Applications can create a new validator context using the
I<val_create_context()> function.  This function parses the resolver and
validator configuration files and creates the handle I<newcontext> to this
parsed information.  Information stored as part of validator context includes
the validation policy and resolver policy.

Validator and resolver policies are read from the B</etc/dnsval.conf> and
B</etc/resolv.conf> files by default.  B</etc/root.hints> provides
bootstrapping information for the validator when it functions as a full
resolver (see I<dnsval.conf(3)>).  The default locations of each of these
files may be changed using the interfaces I<dnsval_conf_set()>,
I<resolv_conf_set()>, and I<root_hints_set()>, respectively.  The
corresponding "get" interfaces (namely I<dnsval_conf_get()>,
I<resolv_conf_get()>, and I<root_hints_get()>) can be used to return the
current location from where these configuration files are read.  The
configuration file locations may also be specified on a per-context basis
using the I<val_create_context_with_conf()> function.

Answers returned by I<val_resolve_and_check()> are made available in the
I<*results> linked list.  Each answer corresponds to a distinct RRset; multiple
RRs within the RRset are part of the same answer.  Multiple answers are possible when
I<type> is I<ns_t_any> or I<ns_t_rrsig>.

Individual elements in I<*results> point to I<val_authentication_chain> linked
lists.  The authentication chain elements in I<val_authentication_chain> contain
the actual RRsets returned by  the name server in response to the query.

Validation result values returned in I<val_result_chain> and
authentication chain status values returned in each element of the
I<val_authentication_chain> linked list can be can be converted into ASCII
format using the I<p_val_status()> and I<p_ac_status()> functions respectively.

While some applications such as DNSSEC troubleshooting utilities and packet
inspection tools may look at individual authentication
chain elements to identify the actual reasons for validation error,
most applications will only be interested in a single error code for determining
the authenticity of data.

I<val_isvalidated()> identifies if a given
validation result status value corresponds to an answer that was
cryptographically verified and validated using a locally configured
trust anchor.

I<val_istrusted()> identifies if a given
validator status value is trusted.  An answer may be locally trusted
without being validated.

I<val_does_not_exist()> identifies if a given
validator status value corresponds to one of the non-existence types.

The I<libval> library internally allocates memory for I<*results> and this
must be freed by the invoking application using the I<free_result_chain()>
interface.

        verification failures or the inability to verify
        proofs for exactly one component in the
        authentication chain below the trust anchor.

    VAL_BOGUS
        Response could not be validated due to signature
        verification failures or the inability to verify
        proofs for an indeterminate number of components
        in the authentication chain.

    VAL_NOTRUST
        All available components in the authentication
        chain verified properly, but there was no trust
        anchor available.

    VAL_IGNORE_VALIDATION
        Local policy was configured to ignore validation
        for the zone from which this data was received.

    VAL_TRUSTED_ZONE
        Local policy was configured to trust
        any data received from the given zone.

    VAL_UNTRUSTED_ZONE
        Local policy was configured to reject
        any data received from the given zone.

    VAL_PROVABLY_UNSECURE
        The record or some ancestor of the record in
        the authentication chain towards the trust
        anchor was known to be provably unsecure.

    VAL_BAD_PROVABLY_UNSECURE
        The record or some ancestor of the record in the
        authentication chain towards the trust anchor was
        known to be provably unsecure. But the provably
        unsecure condition was configured as untrustworthy.

Status values in I<val_status_t> returned by the validator can be displayed
in ASCII format using I<p_val_status()>.

=item I<val_ac_status>

Validation state of the authentication chain element.  This field will

This field may contain one of the following values:

    VAL_AC_UNSET
        The status was not set.

    VAL_AC_DATA_MISSING
        No data were returned for a query and the

        record could not be retrieved.

    VAL_AC_DS_MISSING
        The DS record covering a DNSKEY record was
        not available.

    VAL_AC_NOT_VERIFIED
        All RRSIGs covering the RRset could not
        be verified.

    VAL_AC_VERIFIED
        At least one RRSIG covering a resource
        record had a status of VAL_AC_RRSIG_VERIFIED.

    VAL_AC_TRUST_KEY
        A given DNSKEY or a DS record was locally
        defined to be a trust anchor.

    VAL_AC_IGNORE_VALIDATION
        Validation for the given resource record was ignored,
        either because of some local policy directive or
        because of some protocol-specific behavior.

    VAL_AC_TRUSTED_ZONE
        Local policy defined a given zone as trusted, with
        no further validation being deemed necessary.

    VAL_AC_UNTRUSTED_ZONE
        Local policy defined a given zone as untrusted,
        with no further validation being deemed necessary.

    VAL_AC_PROVABLY_UNSECURE
        The authentication chain from a trust anchor to a
        given zone could not be constructed due to the
        provable absence of a DS record for this zone in
        the parent.

    VAL_AC_BARE_RRSIG
        The response was for a query of type RRSIG.  RRSIGs
        contain the cryptographic signatures for other DNS
        data and cannot themselves be validated.

        There was no trust anchor configured for a given
        authentication chain.
