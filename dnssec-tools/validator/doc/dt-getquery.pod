dt-getquery - command-line test program for the I<val_res_query()> function 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   dt-getquery [options] name 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility is a command-line wrapper around the I<val_res_query()>
function.  It invokes the I<val_res_query()> function with the given
command-line arguments and displays the returned data as a DNS-style response. 
It also displays the validation status value for the records returned for the query.

The exit status for this program is 1 if the answer received is trusted, 2 if
the answer received is validated, and -1 for an error.  The program returns 0 if 
the result was neither trusted nor validated. The trusted and
validated status values are obtained using the I<val_istrusted()> and
I<val_isvalidated()> functions from I<libval(3)>.
