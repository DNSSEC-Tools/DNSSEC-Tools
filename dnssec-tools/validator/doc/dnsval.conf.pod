=head1 NAME

/etc/dnsval.conf - Configuration policy for the DNSSEC validator library libval(3).

/etc/resolv.conf

/etc/root.hints	

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The validator library reads configuration information from three separate
files, B</etc/resolv.conf>, B</etc/root.hints>, and B</etc/dnsval.conf>.

=over 4

=item /etc/resolv.conf

Only the I<nameserver> option is supported in the B<resolv.conf> file.
This option is used to specify the IP address of the name server to which
queries must be sent by default.  For example,

    nameserver 10.0.0.1

The B</etc/resolv.conf> file may be empty in which case the validator in
I<libval(3) > tries to recursively answer the query using information present
in B</etc/root.hints>.

=item /etc/root.hints

The B</etc/root.hints> file contains bootstrapping information for the
resolver while it attempts to recursively answer queries.  The contents of
this file may be generated by the following command:

    dig @e.root-servers.net . ns > root.hints

=item /etc/dnsval.conf

The B</etc/dnsval.conf> file contains a sequence of the following
"policy-fragments":

    <label> <KEYWORD> <additional-data>; 

I<label> identifies the policy fragment 
and I<KEYWORD> is the specific policy component that is 
configured.  The format of additional-data depends on the 
keyword specified.

If multiple policy fragments are defined for the same label and keyword combination
then the last definition in the file is used.

Currently two different keywords are specified:

=over 4

=item trust-anchor

Specifies the trust anchors for a sequence of zones.  The additional
data portion for this keyword is a sequence of the zone name and a 
quoted string containing the RDATA portion for the trust anchor's 
DNSKEY.

=item zone-security-expectation

Specifies the local security expectation for a zone.  The additional
data portion for this keyword is a sequence of the zone name and 
its trust status - ignore, validate or untrusted.
