getaddr - command-line test program for the I<val_gettaddrinfo()> function 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    getaddr [options] <hostname|IPv4 address|IPv6 address>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility is a command-line wrapper around the I<val_getaddrinfo()> function. 
It invokes the I<val_getaddrinfo()> operation for the given command-line
arguments and displays the return code from the function and the contents of the
I<val_addrinfo> structure. 

The exit status for this program is 1 if the answer received is trusted, 2 if 
the answer received is validated, and -1 for an error.  The trusted and

I<val_isvalidated()> functions from I<libval(3)>.
