=head1 NAME

libval_check_conf - command-line program for checking validity of the validator configuration file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS 

    libval_check_conf [options] <dnsval.conf>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program checks the validity of a given validator configuration file, typically named dnsval.conf, for any syntax errors. 
The input to this program is a validator configuration file, but the program also requires valid resolv.conf and root.hints to be
specified. The location for these auxiliary files may be specified using the -r and -i options respectively. If these options are not provided, 
the default resolv.conf and root.hints files recognized by the validator library are used instead. The program displays an error
if the default resolv.conf and root.hints files, and the -i and -r are both unspecified.  

=head1 RETURN VALUE

The program returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
