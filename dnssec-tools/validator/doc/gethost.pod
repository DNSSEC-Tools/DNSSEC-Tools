=head1 NAME

gethost - command-line test program for the I<val_gethostbyname()> (and related) 
functions 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   gethost [options] name 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility is a command-line wrapper around the I<val_gethostbyname()> 
(and related) functions.  It invokes the I<val_gethostbyname()>, 
I<val_gethostbyname_r()> and I<val_gethostbyname2()> functions for the given command-line
arguments and displays the returned hostent, the validation status value, 
and the value of the h_errno variable.

The exit status for this program is 1 if the answer received is trusted, 2 if 
the answer received is validated, and -1 for an error. The trusted and validated
status values are obtained using the I<val_istrusted()> and I<val_isvalidated()> 
functions from I<libval(3)>.
