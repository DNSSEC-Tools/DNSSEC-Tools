=head1 NAME

validate - Query the Domain Name System and display results of the DNSSEC validation process

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  validate

  validate [options] DOMAIN_NAME

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<validate> is a diagnostic tool built on top of the DNSSEC validator.  It
takes I<DOMAIN_NAME> as an argument and queries the DNS for that domain name.
It outputs the series of responses that were received from the DNS and the
DNSSEC validation results for each domain name.  An examination of the queries
and validation results can help an administrator uncover errors in DNSSEC
configuration of DNS zones.

If no options are specified and no I<DOMAIN_NAME> argument is given,
B<validate> will perform a series of pre-defined test queries against
the I<test.dnssec-tools.org> zone.  This serves as a
test-suite for the validator.  If any options are specified (e.g.
configuration file locations), I<-s> or I<--selftest> must be specified
to run the test-suite.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item -c I<CLASS>, --class=I<CLASS>

This option can be used to specify the DNS class of the Resource
Record queried.  If this option is not given, the default class
B<IN> is used.

=item -h, --help

Display the help and exit.

=item -m, --merge

When this option is given, B<validate> will merge different RRsets
in the response into a single answer.  If this option is not given,
each RRset is output as a separate response.  This option makes
sense only when used with the I<-p> option.

=item -p, --print

Print the answers and validation results.  By default, B<validate>
just outputs a series of responses and their validation results on
I<stderr>.  When the I<-p> option is used, B<validate> will also output
the final result on I<stdout>.

=item -t I<TYPE>, --type=I<TYPE>

This option can be used to specify the DNS type of the Resource Record
queried.  If this option is not given, B<validate> will query for the
B<A> record for the given I<DOMAIN_NAME>.

=item -v I<FILE>, --dnsval-conf=I<FILE>

This option can be used to specify the location of the dnsval.conf
configuration file.

=item -r I<FILE>, --resolv-conf=I<FILE>

This option can be used to specify the location of the B<resolv.conf>
configuration file containing the name servers to use for lookups.

=item -i I<FILE>, --root-hints=I<FILE>

This option can be used to specify the location of the root.hints
configuration file, containing the root name servers.  This is only
used when no name server is found, and B<validate> must do recursive
lookups itself.

=item -S I<suite>[:I<suite>], --test-suite=I<suite>[:I<suite>]

This option specifies the test suite (or range of test suites) to use 
for the internal tests.

=item -s, --selftest

This option can be used to specify that the application should perform its
test-suite against the I<dnssec-tools.org> test domain.  If the name servers
configured in the system B<resolv.conf> do not support DNSSEC, use the I<-r>
and I<-i> options to enable B<validate> to use its own internal recursive
resolver.

=item -T I<number>[:I<number>], --testcase=I<number>[:I<number>]

This option can be used to run a specific test (or range of tests) 
from the testsuite.

=item -F I<file>, --testcase-conf=I<file> 

This option is used to specify the file containing the test cases.

=item -l I<label>, --label=I<label> 

This option can be used to specify the policy from within the I<dnsval.conf> 
file to use during validation. 

=item -w I<seconds>, --wait=I<seconds> 

This option can be used to run the queries specified by other flags in a loop,
with the specified interval between successive queries.

=item -o, --output=<debug-level>:<dest-type>[:<dest-options>]

<debug-level> is 1-7, corresponding to syslog levels ALERT-DEBUG
<dest-type> is one of file, net, syslog, stderr, stdout
<dest-options> depends on <dest-type>
    file:<file-name>   (opened in append mode)
    net[:<host-name>:<host-port>] (127.0.0.1:1053
    syslog[:facility] (0-23 (default 1 USER))
