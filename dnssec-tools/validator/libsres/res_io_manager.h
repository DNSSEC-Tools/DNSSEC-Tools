/*
 * res_io_deliver
 * 
 * Enters a query for submission.  After entering the query,
 * a routine is called to check the outgoing data needs which
 * may result in some network traffic being generated.
 * 
 * Parameters
 * 
 * transaction_id is initialized to -1 by caller, then unchanged
 * for the rest of the transaction.
 * 
 * signed_query is a pointer to a query which becomes "owned" by the
 * io manger. signed_length is the length of the query.  The
 * query is sent as it is passed, i.e., it should be TSIG'd
 * before hand.
 * 
 * ns is a structure indicating which name server to use.
 * 
 * Return values
 * 
 * >= 0                 Number of remaining sources pending
 * SR_IO_MEMORY_ERROR   Not enough memory
 * SR_IO_TOO_MANY_TRANS Too many current requests

/*
 * res_io_accept
 * 
 * Requests a response for the indicated transaction.  If there
 * is a response for the transaction, then the first one found is

 * indicated transaction are returned though.
 * 
 * Parameters
 * 
 * transaction_id is the number assigned in the first delivery call.
 * 
 * answer and answer length refer to the response, answer is malloced
 * memory given to the caller for management, answer_length is the
 * response length in bytes

 * Return values
 * 
 * SR_IO_GOT_ANSWER     An answer is being returned
 * SR_IO_NO_ANSWER              No answer is returned, and there are no more
 * sources (the caller may be adding more)
 * SR_IO_NO_ANSWER_YET  No answer, but there are sources still pending
 * SR_IO_SOCKET_ERROR   An unrecoverable (socket()) error in the
 * communications interface.  This should be
 * treated as an internal error, it should not
 * happen after success full porting and testing.
 * SR_IO_INTERNAL_ERROR A null pointer happened where it should not
 * after success porting and compilation.
