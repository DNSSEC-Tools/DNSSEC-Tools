			sendmail-8.13.3 DNSSEC HOWTO
			============================
			       (Version 0.1)

Introduction
============

This HOWTO describes the installation, configuration and execution steps for
adding DNSSEC validation to outbound email for sendmail-8.13.3.


Installation
============

Download sendmail-8.13.3.tar.gz from ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/.

Unzip and untar it by:

	tar -xvzf sendmail-8.13.3.tar.gz

Go to the sendmail-8.13.3 directory:

	cd sendmail-8.13.3

Apply the sendmail-8.13.3_dnssec_patch.txt patch found in this directory by:

	patch -p 0 -b -z .orig </path/to/patch/sendmail-8.13.3_dnssec_patch.txt

This will apply the patch and store the original files with a .orig suffix.

This patch requires the 'libval' library for DNSSEC validation.  This
library can be found at http://dnssec-tools.sourceforge.net/.  You must
install this library before compiling the patched sendmail source.

Add the following line to the sendmail-8.13.3/devtools/Site/site.config.m4
file, if it is not already present:

APPENDDEF(`confLIBS', `-lsres -lval -lcrypto')

Build and install sendmail as per the instructions given in the README and
INSTALL files with the sendmail distribution.


Configuration
=============

To enable DNSSEC validation, the 'RequireDNSSEC' option must be added to the
'ResolverOptions' in the sendmail configuration.  This can be done by
adding the following configuration line to the sendmail.mc file.

define(`confBIND_OPTS', `+RequireDNSSEC')

You will need to generate the sendmail.cf file from sendmail.mc and then
place it in /etc/mail or other sendmail system configuration directory.

To disable DNSSEC validation, remove this option from BIND_OPTS.


Execution
=========

Start sendmail as usual with the sendmail.cf file appropriately configured
with the ResolverOptions.


To Test
=======

(I) Basic Scenarios: DNSSEC validation of outbound email
    ----------------------------------------------------

1. Start sendmail with the above patch applied, and the 'RequireDNSSEC' option
   added to ResolverOptions.
2. Send email to a user at a domain whose MX records can be DNSSEC
   validated.  Verify that the mail goes through properly.
3. Send email to a user at a domain whose MX records cannot be DNSSEC
   validated.  Verify that an SMTP error message is returned back to
   the sender.

4. Remove the 'RequireDNSSEC' option from ResolverOptions and restart sendmail.
   Run steps 2 and 3 above, and verify that mail goes through in both
   cases, since there is no DNSSEC validation.
