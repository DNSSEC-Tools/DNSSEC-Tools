Patch to add local validation to ncftp.

This patch has been tested on ncftp-3.2.0 and 3.2.1.

1) Apply patch
2) run autoheader and autoconf to regenerate several important
   files. I had to use autoconf version 2.13.  This will likely
   require:
   # cd ncftp-3.2.0/autoconf/
   # cp acconfig.h aclocal.m4 ..
   before running autoheader and autoconf.
3) Configure with: ./configure --with-dnssec-local-validation
4) make
5) sudo make install


Note: There is a minor validation hole.  Ncftp bookmarks save the IP
      address.  When bookmarks are used the DNS is not consulted and
      no DNSSEC validation is done.  In practice, this means that if
      the IP address for a hostname changes, the bookmark will
      continue to try and connect to the old address regardless of
      DNS or validation.
