Zabbix is an open-source system for monitoring networks and computers.
An agent plugin has been written to monitor zone rollover controlled by
DNSSEC-Tools.  The modifications were made to Zabbix version 1.8.8.

There are three plugins defined for DNSSEC-Tools and UEM.  These are briefly
described below and more completely described in each plugin's pod.

Each plugin is referenced by Zabbix through a UserParameter entry in the
zabbix_agentd.conf file.  A set of example entries are included here and
they must be modified for site-specific paths and zones.  The keys in the
UserParameter entries must be assigned to Zabbix items, and the items
must be assigned to Zabbix hosts.  They can then be further assigned to
graphs and screens, as any other Zabbix item.


Caveat:  When using these plugins with Zabbix, you must be aware of the
	 frequency of zone rollover actions and the frequency of Zabbix
	 item checks.  It is almost certain that there will be some
	 amount of latency between actual zone rollover status and the
	 rollover status displayed by Zabbix.  This is the nature of
	 the system and it should be expected.  This should only be a
	 problem if your zones are fast-rolling zones.  If a zone has
	 a TTL of just a few minutes, then the Zabbix display may lag
	 behind reality.


Files
-----

This directory contains files for use in Zabbix monitoring of zone
rollover controlled by DNSSEC-Tools.  Brief descriptions of these
files are given below.

	rollstate
		This Perl script is a Zabbix plugin that determines
		the status of a zone.  It is referenced by the
		UserParameter entries defined in zabbix_agentd.conf.

		"perldoc rollstate" will give additional information.

	zonestate
		This Perl script is a Zabbix plugin that determines
		the validity of a zone file.  It is referenced by the
		UserParameter entries defined in zabbix_agentd.conf.

		"perldoc zonestate" will give additional information.

	uemstats
		This Perl script is a Zabbix plugin that retrieves the
		most recent DNS lookup response performed by UEM      
		for a given sensor/name-server/target-host group.
		It is referenced by the UserParameter entries defined
		in zabbix_agentd.conf.

		"perldoc uemstats" will give additional information.

	zabbix_agentd.conf
		This contains a set of sample UserParameter entries
		that run the rollstate and zonestate plugins.  There
		are entries to provide both text and numeric output.

	item.fields
		This contains a brief discussion of a few of the fields
		that must be set when defining an item that uses the
		DNSSEC-Tools rollstate plugin.

	backup-zabbix
		This script backs up the mysql database that stores
		all the data required by Zabbix.
