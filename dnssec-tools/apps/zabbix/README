Zabbix is an open-source system for monitoring networks and computers.
An agent plugin has been written to monitor zone rollover controlled by
DNSSEC-Tools.  The modifications were made to Zabbix version 1.8.8.

The DNSSEC-Tools rollstate plugin provides monitoring information about
a set of zones being managed by rollerd.  It returns either a string
or a number indicating the rollover state for a specified zone.

The rollstate documentation (available by executing "perldoc rollstate")
will provide more information about the use of rollstate.  In particular,
rollstate must be modified to use the proper rollrec file.  This current
prototype has the rollrec's path hard-coded.

rollstate provide two sorts of output.  With the -numeric option, it will
print something like: "3" or "-1".  Without that option, it will print
something like:  "ZSK phase 3" or "KSK phase 1".  The -numeric option
is intended to allow rollover phases to be graphed and the negative
number for KSK phases gives them a distinctive difference on the graph.

This plugin is referenced by Zabbix through a UserParameter entry in the
zabbix_agentd.conf file.  A set of example entries are included here and
they must be modified for site-specific paths and zones.  The keys in the
UserParameter entries must be assigned to Zabbix items, and the items
must be assigned to Zabbix hosts.  They can then be further assigned to
graphs and screens, as any other Zabbix item.


Caveat:  When using these modifications with Zabbix, you must be aware
	 of the frequency of zone rollover actions and the frequency of
	 Zabbix item checks.  It is almost certain that there will be
	 some amount of latency between actual zone rollover status and 
	 the rollover status displayed by Zabbix.  This is the nature of
	 the system and it should be expected.  This should only be a
	 problem if your zones are fast-rolling zones.  If a zone has a
	 TTL of just a few minutes, then the Zabbix display may lag
	 behind reality.

This directory contains files for use in Zabbix monitoring of zone
rollover controlled by DNSSEC-Tools.  Brief descriptions of these
files are given below.

	rollstate
		This Perl script is a Zabbix plugin that determines
		the status of a zone.  It is referenced by the
		UserParameter entries defined in zabbix_agentd.conf.

		"perldoc rollstate" will give additional information.

	zabbix_agentd.conf
		This contains a set of sample UserParameter entries
		that run the rollstate plugin.  There are entries to
		provide both text and numeric output.

	item.fields
		This contains a brief discussion of a few of the fields
		that must be set when defining an item that uses the
		DNSSEC-Tools rollstate plugin.
