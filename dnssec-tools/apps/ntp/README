Local DNSSEC validation for NTP
===============================


This patch adds DNSSEC support to NTP. Additionally, if the ntpd daemon 
is started with the -g option, clock skew will be ignored during the 
validation of DNSSEC reponses. This is to solve a cyclic dependency problem 
where DNSSEC validation relies on accurate system type, and in order to 
adjust time, NTP will need to do a DNS query to the NTP servers.

This patch has been tested on ntp-dev-4.2.7p250 


BUILD
=====

1. Apply the patch

2. Re-generate the configure script
    $ cd ntp-XXX
    $ autoconf
    $ cd sntp
    $ autoconf

3. Run the configure script, enabling DNSSEC and pointing to any 
   non-standard location for necessary libval libraries.
   For example:
    $ LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/lib" \
      CFLAGS="-g -I/usr/local/opt/include" ./configure --with-dnsval
