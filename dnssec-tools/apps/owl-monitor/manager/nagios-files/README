diff-side.php
	This file contains the sidebar entry for displaying an Owl-specific
	version of the Services screen.  This new sidebar command uses the
	modifications to status.cgi described below in diff-status.c. 
	The side.php file lives in .../share/side.php.

diff-status.c
	This file contains the diffs to status.c that will allow a slightly
	different view of the Services display.

	The standard Nagios sidebar has a "Services" link that gives seven
	columns of info.  These columns are for Host, Service, Status, Last
	Check, Duration, Attempt, and Status Information.

	Some unfamiliar with Nagios have found several of these columns
	confusing.  To alleviate the confusion, a flag can be given to
	status.cgi that will remove these confusing columns from the display.
	The new display retains the Host, Service, Status, and Status
	Information columns, and leaves out the Last Check, Duration, and
	Attempt columns.

	A new link in the sidebar, labelled "Services (Owl Display)", will
	cause status.cgi to show the modified display.  Ths link is provided
	in diff-side.php.

	The status.c file lives in .../cgi/status.c.

example-side.php
	This file contains example lines that may be added to Nagios'
	side.php file in order to make graphing more easily available.
	The side.php file lives in .../share/side.php.

owl-sensor-heartbeat.cgi
	This file is a script run by the webserver in order to register
	that an Owl sensor has sent a "heartbeat" signal.
	The owl-sensor-heartbeat.cgi script lives in .../sbin -- or wherever
	your installation wants to store CGI scripts for the webserver.
