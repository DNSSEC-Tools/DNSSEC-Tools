ABOUT OWL
---------

The Owl Monitoring System uses timed Domain Name System (DNS) queries
to monitor basic network functionality.  The system consists of a
manager host and a set of sensor hosts.  The Owl sensors perform
periodic DNS queries and report to the Owl manager the time taken for
each query.  Over time, this shows the responsiveness of the DNS
infrastructure.

The Owl Monitoring System was designed such that the Owl sensor hosts need
not be under the same administrative control as the Owl manager host.  In
fact, each sensor in a set of Owl sensors may be under administrative control
of different organizations and still report to a single Owl manager.
