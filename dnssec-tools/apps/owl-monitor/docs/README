This directory contains documenation for the Owl Monitoring System.  The
installation manual is available in two forms.  

	install-guide.html
		This version of the Owl Installation Manual is a set of
		separate webpages, divided up by stages of the installation
		and operation of the Owl Monitoring System.

		This is the master version of the Owl Installation Manual.

	full-install-guide.html
		This is a monolithic file containing all parts of the Owl 
		Installation Manual.

		This version of the manual was built from the various
		components of the non-monolithic manual.  The docula command
		used the guide-docula.html file as a configuration file
		to produce the single-file version.  After running docula,
		various links within the resulting file were modified to
		account for the single-file format.
