<p>

This section gives installation procedures for installing the Owl Monitoring
software on sensor hosts.  Installation of the Owl sensor is relatively simple.
This requires the creation of a sensor account, SSH initialization, software
installation, and a few other set-up activities.  The most complicated aspect
is likely to be coordinating SSH access with the Owl manager host.  The
required actions for installing an Owl sensor are described in this section.

<p>

The installation instructions discuss software installation of Owl software
and supporting third-party software packages.  There are a number of
Owl-specific configuration actions that must be performed, and these are
detailed in <a href="install-sensor-4-adding-sensor.html#ig-sensor-4.">section 4</a>.

<p>

The Owl sensors <b>require</b> Perl.  You must install it on your system if
it isn't already available.  If the sensor host's Perl or operating system
does not support threading, then each query will run in its own process,
rather than all queries running in their own threads within a single process.

<p>

Below is a diagram of the flow of Owl sensor data on the Owl sensor.  The
details may not make sense at this stage, but this will show how the various
pieces fit together.

<h3>2.1. Create an Owl Sensor Account</h3>

<p>

The Owl sensor will run several daemons and <b>cron</b> jobs.  It is a good
idea, but not an imperative one, for these to run as their own user.  It is
easier to segregate the Owl sensor's actions, processes, and files if they
are performed by a dedicated user.

<p>

However, it is certainly acceptable to run them as yourself or some other
existing user.  If you choose to do this, you may disregard the rest of this
section.

<p>

There are no requirements on the Owl username; it may be anything that
makes sense to you.  Some possibilities are: <i>owl</i>, <i>owl-sensor</i>,
<i>owl-user</i>, <i>bob</i>, and <i>tricorder</i>.

<p>

To create a new user, use your operating system's user-creation command (e.g.,
<b>adduser</b> or <b>useradd</b>) to create a new <i>unprivileged</i> user.

<p>

Examples of commands to create a new user:

<p>

<h3>2.2. SSH Initialization</h3>

<p>

Owl sensor data are transferred to the Owl manager using the <b>rsync</b>
and <b>ssh</b> commands.  You must initialize the Owl sensor user's SSH
environment by generating keys for the <b>ssh</b> command to use.  This
may be dependent on your operating system or the version of SSH installed.

<p>

The OpenSSH package is a widely available SSH package, and its
<b>ssh-keygen</b> command is used to create SSH keys.  This manual
will assume that OpenSSH is being used.

<p>

There are no specific key parameters required by Owl.  The generated key must
be sufficient to allow the sensor and the manager to transfer files without
having to manually enter a password.

<p>

Example of a command to generate a new SSH key:

<pre>
    $ ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t dsa
</pre>

<p>

If the Owl sensor will be pushing data to the manager, then the newly
generated public key must be transferred to the Owl manager host.  This key
must be added to the list of authorized keys for the Owl manager's account.
For OpenSSH, the public key will be in a file called <b>id_dsa.pub</b> and it
will be added to the <b>authorized_keys</b> file on the manager host.  Once
the sensor's public key has been added to the Owl manager, you must ensure
that the Owl sensor user may successfully transfer files to the manager
without need of a password.

<p>

If the Owl manager will be pulling data from the sensor, then you must do the
following things.  First, install the <b>rrsync</b> utility. This is a
front-end to <b>rsync</b> that restricts the locations to which <b>rsync</b>
may copy data.  <b>rrsync</b> is available here:
<b>http://ftp.samba.org/pub/unpacked/rsync/support/rrsync</b>.  Next, the
manager's administrator must provide you with a public SSH key.  This public
key must be added to the <b>authorized_keys</b> file belonging to the Owl
sensor account.

<p>

The <b>authorized_keys</b> entry should look something like this:

<pre>
    command="/usr/local/bin/rrsync /owl/data/sensor42" ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza...A3Q== owl-manager@owl.example.com
</pre>

<p>

<h3>2.3. Install the Owl Environment</h3>

<p>

You must select a place to install the Owl sensor's files.  The files and
directories may live in the Owl sensor user's home directory, a subdirectory
beneath that home directory, or somewhere else entirely.  For ease of finding
these files later, it may be helpful to keep the Owl sensor's files all
beneath a single directory.

<p>

There are a set of directories that will be used by the Owl sensor: <b>bin</b>,
<b>conf</b>, and <b>perllib</b>.  These names shouldn't be changed.

<p>

Additional modifications to the Owl sensor environment will be discussed
in <a href="install-sensor-4-adding-sensor.html#ig-sensor-4.1.">section 4.1</a>.

<p>

Several installation examples are given below.  For each, it is assumed
the Owl sensor user is named <i>owl-sensor</i>.  

<p>

Installation example 1:  In this case, the software will be installed
in the sensor user's home directory by unpacking a tar file located in
<b>/tmp/owl-sensor.tar.gz</b>.

<p>

<pre>
    $ cd ~owl-sensor
    $ tar xzf /tmp/owl-sensor.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>

Installation example 2:  In this case, the software will be installed in a
subdirectory within the sensor user's home directory by unpacking a tar file
located in <b>/tmp/owl-sensor.tar.gz</b>.

<p>

<pre>
    $ mkdir ~owl-sensor/owl-dir
    $ cd ~owl-sensor/owl-dir
    $ tar xzf /tmp/owl-sensor.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<h3>2.4. Install Required Perl Modules</h3>

<p>

There is a set of Perl modules required by the Owl sensor.
These should be available through CPAN.

<p>

Modules required by the Owl sensor:
<table>
<td valign=top>
<ul>
<li>Cwd.pm
<li>Date::Format.pm
<li>FindBin.pm
<li>Getopt::Long.pm
<li>LWP::Simple.pm
<li>Log::Dispatch.pm
<li>Log::Dispatch::FileRotate.pm
<li>Net::DNS.pm
</ul>
</td>
<td width=50>&nbsp;
<td valign=top>
<ul>
<li>Net::DNS::Packet.pm
<li>Net::DNS::Resolver.pm
<li>POSIX.pm
<li>Time::HiRes.pm
<li>Time::Local.pm
<li>threads.pm
<li>threads::shared.pm
</ul>
</td>
</table>

<p>

If the two threads-related modules are unavailable for your system, or if your
version of Perl doesn't support threading, then the Owl sensor will run each
query in its own process.  In this case, these two modules are not needed.
