<h3>Setting Up the Owl Monitoring System</h3>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

The Owl Monitoring System uses timed Domain Name System (DNS) queries to
monitor basic network functionality.  The system consists of a manager host
and a set of sensor hosts.  The Owl sensors perform periodic DNS queries and
report to the Owl manager the time taken for each query.  Over time, this
shows the responsiveness of the DNS infrastructure.

<p>

The Owl Monitoring System was designed such that the Owl sensor hosts need
not be under the same administrative control as the Owl manager host.  In
fact, each sensor in a set of Owl sensors may be under administrative control
of different organizations and still report to a single Owl manager.

<p>

An Owl sensor may provide its data to more than one Owl manager.  In such
situations, the managers operate independently of each other and do not know
of each other's existence.  Throughout the installation manuals, it will be
assumed that an installation will have a single manager.  Special instructions
for multiple-manager environments will be given where needed.

<p>

Contact between sensors and their manager may be initiated and performed by
the sensor or the manager.  This is a configuration decision that must be made
on a case by case basis.  The push or pull model may cover all of an Owl
manager's sensors.  For example, a particular manager may initiate sensor data
retrieval from all of its sensors.  Also, the push/pull model may be specific
to each sensor, so a particular manager could retrieve data from one sensor
but wait for another sensor to provide its data.

<p>

This document provides an operational overview of the Owl system, installation
instructions for the Owl and supporting third-party software.  Configuration
instructions for the Owl software are also provided, along with configuration
information for the required third-party software.

<p>

<h3>How To Use This Manual</h3>

<p>

There are two installation manuals, one for the manager and one for the sensor.
Sensor administrators only need to read the 
<a href="install-sensor.html">Owl Sensor Installation Manual</a>.
Manager administrators only need to read the 
<a href="install-manager.html">Owl Manager Installation Manual</a>
As you might expect, those who are administrators for both manager and sensor
hosts must read both installation guides.
