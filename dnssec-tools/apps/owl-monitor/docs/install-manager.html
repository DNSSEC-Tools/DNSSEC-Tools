<h3>0. Setting Up Managers for the Owl Monitoring System</h3>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

The Owl Monitoring System uses timed Domain Name System (DNS) queries to
monitor basic network functionality.  The system consists of a manager host
and a set of sensor hosts.  The Owl sensors perform periodic DNS queries and
report to the Owl manager the time taken for each query.  Over time, this
shows the responsiveness of the DNS infrastructure.

<p>

An Owl sensor is configured to send DNS queries to a set of DNS nameservers.
The queries may be for a variety of DNS resource record types, and they are
sent to a specific nameserver to request data about a specific target host.
For example, one query might request that the D root nameserver return NS
records for the "www.example.com" host, while another query might request
that a local (non-root) nameserver return AAAA records for the
"mail.example.com" host.  Data will be collected for each configured query
and given to the Owl manager to whom the sensor reports.  The different
sensors in the sensor set may perform different queries or the same queries.

<p>

A configuration file controls the behavior of the Owl sensor.  This file
defines the queries that the sensor will perform, the Owl manager (or
managers) to whom the sensor reports, locations of data and log files,
frequency of queries, and other important behaviors.

<p>

An Owl sensor may provide its data to more than one Owl manager.  In such
situations, the managers operate independently of each other and do not know
of each other's existence.  Throughout the installation manuals, it will be
assumed that an installation will have a single manager.  Special instructions
for multiple-manager environments will be given where needed.

<p>

This document provides an operational overview of the Owl system, installation
instructions for the Owl manager and the third-party software that supports it.
Instructions for configuring the Owl manager are also given.
