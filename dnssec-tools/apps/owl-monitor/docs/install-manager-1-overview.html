The Owl Monitoring System has a conceptually simple method of operations.
There is a manager host and a set of sensor hosts.  The sensors periodically
make a set of DNS queries and time how long it takes to get a response.  The
response times are saved to data files.  After a certain amount of time, the
data files are transferred from the sensor to the manager host.  For any
particular sensor, this data transfer may be configured to be initiated by
either the manager or by the sensor.  The manager transfers the data into
a monitoring package, which allows easy display of the data.

<p>

Below is a diagram of the flow of Owl sensor data through two Owl monitoring
installations.

<p>

Take note of the following:

<ul>
<li>There are three distinct administrative domains, two of which have Owl
managers.
<li>Owl Manager 1 receives sensor data from all three domains.
<li>Owl Manager 2 receives sensor data from itself and one other domain.
<li>Domain 1's sensors do not provide data to other domains.
<li>Domain 2 contains an Owl sensor, but not an Owl manager. 
<li>Owl sensors in the domains 2 and 3 provide data to Owl managers outside
of their own domain.
<li>Owl sensors can query multiple name servers.
</ul>

(Domains in this example are defining administrative control and are <u>not</u>
DNS domains.)

<p>

The remainder of this section provides a little more information on the
components that make up the sensor and manager software.

<h3>1.1. Owl Sensor Overview</h3>

<p>

An Owl sensor makes timed DNS queries and records the time required for a
response.  The response time data are transferred to the Owl manager after
a certain period of time.  The transfer may occur at the instigation of
either the manager or the sensor.  The Owl sensor's three primary programs
that handle these tasks are described below.

<p>

The Owl sensor's actions are controlled by a configuration file.  This file
defines the queries that must be performed, how often the queries must
happen, how frequently the response data files are transferred to the
manager, data and logging information, and other required information.

<p>

The <b>owl-dnstimer</b> program performs periodic DNS lookups, as specified by
the configuration file.  These lookups are timed so that the sensor can record
how long it took to make a particular request.  The configuration parameters
used by <b>owl-dnstimer</b> include the nameserver to query, the target zone
to query about, the type of DNS record, and the frequency of queries.

<p>

If the Owl system is configured so that the sensor transfers its data to the
manager, then the transfer is performed by the
<b>owl-transfer</b> program.  The transfers are performed using <b>rsync</b>
over an <b>ssh</b> connection.  The sensor host must be able to do a
password-less <b>ssh</b> into the manager host.  The frequency of transfers
is defined in the configuration file.  Choosing the transfer frequency is a
trade-off between lower impact on the sensor, manager, and network (less
frequent) and lower latency of data display on the manager (more frequent.)

<p>

The <b>owl-sensord</b> program is an optional controller for <b>owl-dnstimer</b>
and <b>owl-transfer</b>.  If used, it will run these daemons and restart them
if they stop.  If one of the daemons tries to restart too often in too short
a time, then <b>owl-sensord</b> will warn an administrator (via email) and
temporarily stop trying to execute the program.  <b>owl-sensord</b> is not
required in order to run <b>owl-dnstimer</b> and <b>owl-transfer</b>; the Owl
sensor can run fine without it.  However, it provides a convenient way to keep
them running.

<p>

As part of the installation process, you must decide whether you will run the
Owl sensor using the <b>owl-sensord</b> daemon to control execution or if you
will run <b>owl-dnstimer</b> and <b>owl-transfer</b> directly.

<p>

The Owl sensor has a number of programs for administrative support.  Most
of these are not required, but they assist in sensor administration.  In
particular, the <b>owl-dataarch</b> and <b>owl-heartbeat</b> programs are
intended to run as <b>cron</b> jobs.  <b>owl-dataarch</b> moves "old" sensor
data into an archive directory, in order to keep the sensor-manager data
transfer from bogging down (within <b>rsync</b>) as the data collection grows.
The <b>owl-heartbeat</b> program periodically touches a webpage hosted on the
Owl manager, in order to let the manager know that the sensor host is still
running.  <b>owl-heartbeat</b> is not critical and can be left off, but
<b>owl-dataarch</b> is essential.  There are a few other administrative
commands available; see
<a href="install-sensor-6-commands.html#ig-sensor-6">section 6</a>
for a brief description of all the Owl sensor commands.

<p>

<h3>1.2. Owl Manager Overview</h3>

<p>

The Owl manager's purpose is to receive sensor data and make it available for
display.  The majority of the Owl manager is actually third-party packages,
and the Owl manager software provides the "glue" that allows the Owl sensor
data to work with those packages.  In particular, Owl provides data to the
Nagios monitoring system, which then displays the data.

<p>

The Owl sensors may report to managers that are under separate administrative
control.  A particular installation of the Owl Monitoring System may use
multiple manager hosts, but this document assumes that there is only one.

<p>

The manager can have either an active or passive role in the process of moving
Owl sensor data from the sensor to the manager.  If the manager is active, it
will use the <b>owl-transfer-mgr</b> program to pull sensor data from the Owl
sensor host.  If the manager is passive, then the sensor will transfer the
data when it sees fit.

<p>

The are two groups of "glue" programs that Owl uses to interface with
Nagios.  The <b>owl-dnswatch</b> and <b>owl-perfdata</b> inject Owl
sensor DNS response data into Nagios for display and graphing.  The
<b>owl-sensor-heartbeat.cgi</b> and <b>owl-stethoscope</b> programs
insert Owl "heartbeat" data into Nagios so it can track availability
of the Owl sensors.

<p>

The Owl manager also has a number of programs for administrative support.
Most of these are not required, but they assist in manager administration.
In particular, the <b>owl-archdata</b> and <b>owl-monthly</b> programs are
intended to run as <b>cron</b> jobs.  <b>owl-archdata</b> moves "old" sensor
data into an archive directory, in order to keep data transfer from the sensor
from bogging down as the data collection grows.  The <b>owl-monthly</b>
program archives the previous month's sensor data into a compressed tarfile.
<b>owl-newsensor</b> and <b>owl-initsensor</b> assist in setting up the
manager for a new sensor.  There are a few others available; see
<a href="install-manager-7-commands.html#ig-manager-7">section 7</a>
for a brief description of all the Owl manager commands.

<p>

The following third-party software packages are used in with this distribution
of the Owl Monitoring System.  The packages are not included with the Owl
distribution, but must be retrieved as required for your operating system.
These packages must be installed on the manager:

<p>

<table>
<tr><td width=40>&nbsp;<td width=150><li>Nagios<td>Monitoring system.
<tr><td>&nbsp;<td><li>Nagios plugins<td>Monitoring system.
<tr><td>&nbsp;<td><li><b>nagiosgraph</b><td>Provides graphing for Nagios.
<tr><td>&nbsp;<td><li><b>rrdtool</b><td>Database tool for use by <b>nagiosgraph</b>.
<tr><td>&nbsp;<td><li><b>drraw.cgi</b><td>Draws graphs for <b>nagiosgraph</b> of data stored by <b>rrdtool</b>.
</table>

<p>

Instructions are given in this document for integrating these packages with
the Owl software.  It would be for the best to read the installation
instructions below for each package <i>prior</i> to installing them.

<p>

Different management, graphing, and database tools may be used instead of
those listed above, if so desired.  Integrating the Owl manager software
with other packages is beyond the scope of this manual.

<p>

David Josephsen's <u>Building a Monitoring Infrastructure with Nagios</u>
is very helpful for understanding Nagios and how the various pieces work
together.  If you're going to be running a Nagios monitor, you would be
doing yourself a favor to read this book.

<h3>1.3. Data Retention on Owl Hosts</h3>

<p>

Owl sensors generate a large amount of DNS response data.  For example, a
sensor running five queries, once a minute each, generated roughly 517KB of
data per day.  (Due to the way the data are stored, this will be affected by
the amount length of target and nameserver hostnames used.)  You may or may
not want to retain any of this data.  The data files can be useful for
rebuilding the Owl manager's <b>rrdtool</b> databases (or building with
different parameters.)

<p>

On both the Owl manager and the Owl sensors, sensor data are stored in
a data directory.  After a few days, the data files are moved to a data
archive directory.  A full month's data files will be collapsed into a
compressed format.

<p>

The Owl Monitoring System provides tools that assist with managing Owl sensor
data.  After the sensor data have been moved from the sensor to the manager,
the sensor has no further need of the data.  On the manager, after the data
have been moved into the data archive, the Owl Monitoring System has no
further need of the old data; it may be retained or deleted.  (The data will
have been moved into the manager's <b>rrdtool</b> databases by then, so the
data is not lost.)  Each installation must decide their own data retention
policy.
