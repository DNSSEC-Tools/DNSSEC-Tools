<h3>7. Owl Manager Commands</h3>

<p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>

The Owl manager has a number of Owl-specific commands required for its
operation.  This section provides a brief overview of the commands available
to it.  These are all Perl scripts and have self-contained man pages, which
contain greater details about their use.  These scripts are intended to run
as an unprivileged user.

<!------------------------------------------------------->

<p>

This section briefly describes the software used on the Owl manager.

<ul>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-archdata</b><br>
This script archives Owl sensor data for all the defined sensors.  Old data
are moved from the Owl data directory to an archive directory.
<b>owl-archdata</b> runs the <b>owl-dataarch-mgr</b> script for each sensor.
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-archold</b><br>
This script archives previously archived Owl sensor data into monthly
archives.  A compressed <b>tar</b> file is created that contains the archived
data files from a particular month.  It should only be run on a particular
month's archive after the month has been completed.  This script is exactly
the same as the <b>owl-archold</b> on the Owl sensor hosts.  <b>owl-archold</b>
is executed by <b>owl-monthly</b>, but may be used on its own.
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-dataarch-mgr</b><br>
This script archives Owl sensor data for a single sensor.  Old data are moved
from the Owl data directory to an archive directory.  <b>owl-dataarch-mgr</b>
is executed by <b>owl-archdata</b>, but may be used on its own.
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-dnswatch</b><br>
This script retrieves Owl sensor DNS response data and makes it available to
the Nagios monitoring system.
<br>
This script should live in the Nagios <b>libexec</b> directory of plugins.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-initsensor</b><br>
This script creates the required directories and heartbeat file when adding a
new Owl sensor.
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-monthly</b><br>
This script archives previously archived Owl sensor data for all the sensors
defined for an Owl manager.  Compressed <b>tar</b> files are created that
contain the archived data files from a particular months, one <b>tar</b> file
for each sensor.  <b>owl-monthly</b> executes <b>owl-archold</b> to perform
the actually archiving.
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-newsensor</b><br>
This script creates required Nagios objects for a new Owl sensor.  The
objects to be created are based on the data files from the new sensor that
have arrived on the Owl manager. 
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-perfdata</b><br>
This script is translates Owl sensor data from the format provided to Nagios
into the format required by the graphing and database software.
<br>
This script should live in the Nagios <b>libexec</b> directory of plugins.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-sensor-heartbeat.cgi</b><br>
This script records a "heartbeat" for Owl sensors.  When a sensor runs this
script (by way of the Owl manager's web server), the time of the execution
will be recorded for that sensor.
<br>
This script should live in the <b>cgi-bin</b> directory for either the web
server or for Nagios.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-stethoscope</b><br>
This script gathers Owl sensor "heartbeat" data and makes it available to the
Nagios monitoring system.
<br>
This script should live in the Nagios <b>libexec</b> directory of plugins.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-transfer-mgr</b><br>
This script periodically transfers Owl sensor data from the sensor host to
the manager host.
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.

<br>
