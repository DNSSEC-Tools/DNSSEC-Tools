<!------------------------------------------------------------>

Whenever a new Owl sensor is added to those handled by an Owl manager, there
are a number of actions that must take place on both the sensor and the
manager.  These actions should be followed consecutively within each section.
However, there is some amount of necessary interleaving of sensor actions and
manager actions.  For example, a particular sensor action may be required
before a particular manager action.

<p>

It is acceptable for the Owl sensor and Owl manager to be under completely
different administrative control.  Each host may even be owned by different
commercial, educational, governmental, or other such entity.  All that is
required is that there be some initial coordination between administrators
when the sensor is first configured, along with (probably) aperiodic support
from time to time later.

<p>

The discussions on adding Owl sensors assumes that the sensor and manager
are under different administrative control.  Required actions will not change
if they are under unified administrative control, but they may be easier to
accomplish. 

<p>

This section describes the configuration and testing actions that must be
undertaken in order to have a working Owl sensor.  It assumes the installation
procedures detailed in
<a href="install-sensor-2-installation.html#2.1.">section 2.1</a>
have been completed.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="4.1."></a>
<h3>4.1. Firewall Configuration</h3>

<p>

The Owl sensor and the Owl manager communicate by way of SSH and HTTP.  If the
Owl sensor is protected by a firewall (either on the sensor host itself or by
an enterprise-level firewall) then the firewall must be configured to allow
data to be transferred between the sensor and the manager.  The direction of
this transfer (initiated by sensor or initiated by manager) depends on the Owl
configuration.  These firewall modifications are far beyond the scope of this
document.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="4.2."></a>
<h3>4.2. SSH Set-up</h3>

<p>

You must generate a new SSH key for the sensor's Owl user.

<p>

If the sensor will be transferring data to the manager, then you must provide
the public key to the administrator of the Owl manager.  This key will allow
<b>owl-transfer</b> to pass Owl sensor data to the manager.  You must generate
keys with key characteristics (e.g., length and type) that are acceptable to
the manager's administrator.

<p>

If the manager will be pulling data from the sensor, then the manager's
administrator must provide you with the manager host's public key.  You must
add this key to your <b>authorized_keys</b> file.  This key will allow
<b>owl-transfer-mgr</b> to retrieve Owl sensor data.  If you have particular
key requirements (e.g., length and type), then you must give them to the the
manager's administrator.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="4.3."></a>
<h3>4.3. Get Configuration Data from Manager</h3>

<p>

There are several pieces of information that must be provided by the
administrator of the Owl manager.  These include values for the sensor's
configuration file and the sensor's name.

<p>

The following data will allow the sensor to work with the Owl manager as
expected.  These data are used, in conjunction with the <i>manager</i>
keyword, in the sensor's configuration file.

<p>

<table>

<tr>
<td valign=top>Configuration&nbsp;Field
<td valign=top width=20>&nbsp;
<td valign=top>Purpose
<td valign=top width=20>&nbsp;
<td valign=top>Example

<tr>
<td valign=top><i>ssh-user</i>
<td width=20>&nbsp;
<td valign=top>User on Owl manager with which <b>owl-transfer</b> will connect
via <b>ssh</b>.<br>
This is only required if the sensor will be transferring data to the manager.
<td width=20>&nbsp;
<td valign=top>sensor-ottawa@owl-manager.example.com

<tr>
<td valign=top><i>heartbeat</i>
<td width=20>&nbsp;
<td valign=top>URL to provide "heartbeat" data to manager.<br>
This is only required if the sensor will be providing heartbeat data.
<td width=20>&nbsp;
<td valign=top>http://owl.example.com/cgi-bin/owl-sensor-heartbeat.cgi

</table>

<p>

In addition to these data, it would be a good idea for you and the manager
administrator to agree on a name for the sensor.  This is not a hostname, but
is a name by which your sensor will be known to the Owl Monitoring System.
Name agreement between sensor and manager isn't required, but it will probably
make things easier for you both in the long run to refer to the sensor by the
same name.

<p>

The sensor name can be very generic, such as <i>sensor42</i>, <i>sensor-d</i>,
or <i>owl-us-east</i>.  It can also be very specific, such as
<i>washdc-1600-penn-ave-nw</i> or <i>cheltenham-bldg4</i>.  The intent is
to provide distinguishing information to the intended audience of the DNS
monitoring data.  You should use names that easily distinguish sensors and
are acceptable to the manager and sensor administrators.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<h3>4.4. Set Up the Owl Configuration File</h3>

<p>

The Owl configuration file must be initialized.  The data fields include
sensor information, query definitions, file locations, transfer intervals,
and information about contacting the manager.

<p>

The following is a sample <b>owl.conf</b> file:

<pre>
	host name rome-sensor
	host sensor-args	-config /home/owl/conf/owl.conf
	host transfer-args	-conf /home/owl/conf/owl.conf
	host admin		owl-mgmt bob@example.com

	query		example.com	d	ns
	query		example.com	d	a
	query		.		h	A
	query		.		m

	data	dir		data
	data	interval	60

	log	dir		log

	remote	ssh-user	owl-mgr@owlmonitor.example.com

	remote	heartbeat	http://owlmonitor.example.com/cgi-bin/owl-sensor-heartbeat.cgi
</pre>

<p>

The full definition of the configuration file may be found in the
<b>owl-config.pod</b> manpage.

<p>

The sensor configuration file must include a set of query definitions.  These
are best specified by the administrator of the Owl manager, but you must be
willing to generate and transfer the volume of data required by those queries.
The impact won't be as large for the sensor as it will be for the manager
since the manager is likely to have multiple sensors for which it will store
data.

<p>

In addition, the manager-contact fields must be set with data provided by the
administrator of the Owl manager.  The <i>ssh-user</i> field is required for
transfer of data files.  The <i>heartbeat</i> field is optional, but must be
specified if the sensor will provide "heartbeat" information to the manager.

<p>

When translated to the configuration file format, the example lines from
<a href="install-sensor-4-adding-sensor.html#4.4.">section 4.3</a>
will look like the following:

<pre>
	manager ssh-user        sensor-ottawa@owl-manager.example.com
	manager heartbeat	http://owl.example.com/cgi-bin/owl-sensor-heartbeat.cgi
</pre>

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="4.5."></a>
<h3>4.5. Test Transfer to Manager</h3>

<p>

At this point, the manager should be ready to accept data from the Owl
sensor.  Test that this will succeed with the following steps:

<p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure the Owl manager's administrator is ready for this test.
<li>Put a file in the data directory -- specified in the <i>data dir</i>
field of the configuration file.  It doesn't matter what the file's name is
nor its contents.
<li>Inform the manager's administrator of the name of the file.
<li>Run a test transfer in one of these ways:
<ul>
<li>If the sensor will be transferring data to the manager, then run
"owl-transfer -config &lt;config-file&gt; -foreground".<br>
<li>If the manager will be transferring data from the sensor, then the
manager's administrator must run the <b>owl-transfer-mgr</b> command.
</ul>
</ol>

<p>

If the file was successfully transferred, then the Owl sensor is ready to
start generating data and providing it to the manager.

<p>

If not, you must determine why the file wasn't transferred.
<b>owl-transfer</b> uses the <b>rsync</b> and <b>ssh</b> commands
to perform the transfer, so problem diagnosis should start with them.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="4.6."></a>
<h3>4.6. Add Start-up Entries</h3>

<p>

As discussed in <a href="install-sensor-1-overview.html#1.1.">section 1.1</a>,
you must decide whether you will run the Owl sensor using the
<b>owl-sensord</b> daemon or if you will run <b>owl-dnstimer</b> and
<b>owl-transfer</b> directly.  Both methods are acceptable; the first
is more robust in the case of problems.

<p>

In any event, you must add entries to your operating system's boot process
to start the appropriate Owl daemons.  This is highly dependent on the
operating system, and may involve such things as adding some lines to
<b>/etc/rc.local</b> or adding a start-up file to <b>/etc/rc.d/rc2.d</b>.

<p>

These lines executing the Owl sensor daemons may look something like this:

<pre>
        /home/owl/bin/owl-sensord -config /home/owl/bin/conf/owl.conf
</pre>

or

<pre>
        /home/owl/bin/owl-dnstimer -config /home/owl/bin/conf/owl.conf
        /home/owl/bin/owl-transfer -config /home/owl/bin/conf/owl.conf
</pre>

<p>

It is incumbent upon the installer to determine the proper method of Owl
start-up and the proper place to set up execution.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="4.7."></a>
<h3>4.7. Add <b>cron</b> Entries</h3>

<p>

The <b>owl-dataarch</b>, <b>owl-archold</b>, and <b>owl-heartbeat</b> programs
provide additional services for the Owl Monitoring System.  These programs are
not required, but they can ease some of the burden of administering an Owl
sensor.  However, due to the volume of data generated by an Owl sensor, it
is strongly advised that <b>owl-dataarch</b> be run.

<p>

These programs may be set up as <b>cron</b> jobs.  This will remove the
necessity for the administrator to run these programs manually, and it will
provide regularity to their execution.

<p>

<b>owl-dataarch</b> periodically moves sensor data from the data directory to
an archive directory.  It should be run on a daily basis.

<p>

<b>owl-archold</b> will create a compressed tarfile of a month's data that has
been previously stored in the archive directory.  It should be run on a
monthly basis -- but not on the first or second day of the month.  If the
sensor host is used for much other than as an Owl sensor, then it would be
best to run <b>owl-archold</b> whenever the system is normally at "off hours."

<p>

<b>owl-heartbeat</b> touches a webpage (specified in the configuration file)
and is intended to inform the Owl manager that the sensor is up and running.
This may be run as often as desired.  The more frequently it's run, the more
up-to-date is the information on the Owl manager.  The less frequently it's
run, the lower the granularity of the sensor-availability information on the
manager.  Once per minute or hour is probably sufficient for most purposes. 

<p>

<center>
<table border=1>
<tr>
<td width=120 align=center><b>Program</b>
<td width=275 align=center><b>Frequency of Execution</b>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<b>owl-dataarch</b>
<td>&nbsp;once per day

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<b>owl-archold</b>
<td>&nbsp;once per month,<br>&nbsp;on the 3rd of the month or later

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<b>owl-heartbeat</b>
<td>&nbsp;as desired,<br>&nbsp;but once per minute or hour is reasonable

</table>
</center>

<p>

<h3>4.8. Start Owl Daemons</h3>

<p>

Installation and configuration are complete for the Owl sensor.  The Owl
sensor is now ready to gather timing data on DNS queries.  If the sensor will
be transferring data to the Owl manager, it is ready for that task as well.
To start the Owl sensor daemons, you can either start them manually (either
by running just <b>owl-sensord</b> or by running both <b>owl-dnswatch</b>
and <b>owl-transfer</b>) or by rebooting your system.
