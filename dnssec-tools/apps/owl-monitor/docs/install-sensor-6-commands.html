<h3>6. Owl Sensor Commands</h3>

<p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>

The Owl sensor has a number of Owl-specific commands required for its
operation.  This section provides a brief overview of the available commands.
These are all Perl scripts and have self-contained man pages, which contain
greater details about their use.  These scripts are intended to run as an
unprivileged user.

<p>

This section briefly describes the software used on the Owl sensor hosts.

<ul>

<li><b>owl-archold</b><br>
This script archives previously archived Owl sensor data into monthly
archives.  A compressed <b>tar</b> file is created that contains the archived
data files from a particular month.  It should only be run on a particular
month's archive after the month has been completed.  This script is exactly
the same as the <b>owl-archold</b> on the Owl manager host.
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-dataarch</b><br>
This script moves data from the Owl sensor's active data directory to a
year/month-specific archive directory.  This script archives Owl sensor
data by moving old data from the Owl data directory to an archive directory.
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-dnstimer</b><br>
This script is the primary part of the Owl sensor.  It sends periodic DNS
requests to the root nameservers and records the time each request takes.
These query records are provided to the Owl manager for aggregation and
display.
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-heartbeat</b><br>
This script periodically contacts the Owl manager to let it know the sensor
is still alive.  <b>owl-heartbeat</b> is an optional service for the benefit
of the Owl manager's administrators; the Owl sensor will run just fine if a
sensor's administrator elects not to run it.  This is intended to be a
<b>cron</b> job that runs once a minute, but other time periods may be chosen.
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-sensord</b><br>
This script executes the <b>owl-dnstimer</b> and <b>owl-transfer</b> daemons
and monitors their execution.  If either of the daemons exits unexpectedly,
then <b>owl-sensord</b> will restart it.  In order to keep configuration or
other problems from causing rapid re-executions, <b>owl-sensord</b> will
temporarily suspend execution of one of the daemons if a certain number of
execution attempts fail within a short period of time.
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-status</b><br>
This script gives the user a simple view of the status of the three primary
Owl sensor components.  It reports whether or not <b>owl-dnstimer</b>,
<b>owl-sensord</b>, and <b>owl-transfer</b> are running.  An additional
option shows the query parameters used by <b>owl-dnstimer</b> and the time
that each root nameserver was last queried.
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.

<p>

<!--------------------------------------------->

<li><b>owl-transfer</b><br>
This script periodically transfers Owl sensor data from the sensor host to
the manager host.
<br>
This script is assumed to live in the Owl user's home or <b>bin</b> directory.
