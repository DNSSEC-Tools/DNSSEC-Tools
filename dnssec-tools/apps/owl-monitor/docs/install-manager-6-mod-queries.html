From time to time, you might decide to change the queries being performed
by the Owl sensors.  This could be adding new queries to some or all of the
sensors, stopping some of the queries from being performed, or modifying
existing queries.  Regardless of the changes, there are actions that must
be taken on the Owl manager and all affected Owl sensors.

<p>

<!---------------------------------------->

<h3>6.1. Adding New Queries</h3>

<p>

Adding new queries to the Owl manager is a matter of informing Nagios that it
should report on new data.  This is accomplished by adding new Nagios objects
for the sensor.  The following actions must be performed:

<p>

<ol>

<li>Wait for the query changes to take place in the Owl sensor.  You will
know this has happened when new sensor data files start appearing in the
sensor's data directory, if you are adding queries, or fewer data files
are arriving, if you are removing queries.

<p>

<li>Build new Nagios objects for the new queries' data files.  This may be
most simply accomplished by rerunning <b>owl-newsensor</b> for the affected
sensor.  This will rebuild <u>all</u> the sensor's Nagios objects, so you
must take this into account if you have made manual changes to the object
file.  See <a href="install-manager-4-adding-sensor.html#ig-manager-4.7.">section 4.7</a>
and <a href="install-manager-4-adding-sensor.html#ig-manager-4.8.">section 4.8</a>
for more information on creating new Nagios objects.

<p>

<li>Perform the actions in
<a href="install-manager-4-adding-sensor.html#ig-manager-4.10.">section 4.10.</a>
in order to restart Nagios.

<p>

<li>With  sensor query data arriving, you might want to consider modifying
your graphs to display the changes in sensor data.  See
<a href="install-manager-5-define-graphs.html#ig-manager-5.">section 5</a>
for information on defining graphs.

<p>

</ol>

<p>

<h3>6.2. Deleting Old Queries</h3>

<p>

Deleting existing queries to the Owl manager is a matter of informing Nagios
that it should stop reporting on existing data.  This is accomplished by
deleting Nagios objects for the sensor.  The following actions must be
performed:

<p>

<ol>

<li>Edit the Nagios object files to delete the objects for the unwanted
queries.  See <a href="install-manager-4-adding-sensor.html#ig-manager-4.7.">section
4.7</a> and <a href="install-manager-4-adding-sensor.html#ig-manager-4.8.">section
4.8</a> for more information on Nagios objects.

<p>

<li>Perform the actions in
<a href="install-manager-4-adding-sensor.html#ig-manager-4.10.">section 4.10</a>
in order to restart Nagios.

<p>

</ol>

After performing these steps, the old data files will still exist on the
manager.  They can be archived or deleted as desired.
