<!------------------------------------------------------------>

<!--- {docula start} --->
Whenever a new Owl sensor is added to those handled by an Owl manager, there
are a number of actions that must take place on both the sensor and the
manager.  These actions should be followed consecutively within each section.
However, there is some amount of necessary interleaving of actions.  For
example, a particular sensor action may be required before a particular
manager action.

<p>

It is acceptable for the Owl sensor and Owl manager to be under completely
different administrative control.  Each host may even be owned by different
commercial, educational, governmental, or other such entity.  All that is
required is that there be some initial coordination between administrators
when the sensor is first configured, along with (probably) aperiodic support
from time to time later.

<p>

The discussions on adding Owl sensors assumes that the sensor and manager
are under different administrative control.  Required actions will not change
if they are under unified administrative control, but they may be easier to
accomplish. 

<p>

This section describes the various actions that must be performed on the
Owl manager in order to configure a new sensor for it.  This assumes the
installation and configuration procedures detailed in
<a href="install-manager-2-installation.html">section 2</a>
have been completed.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.1."></a>
<h3>4.1. Create Directories and Files for Sensor's Data</h3>

<p>

A set of directories and files must be created for a new sensor.  These are
the sensor directory, the sensor's data directory, the history directory, the
data archive directory.  The heartbeat file, if the sensor will be providing
heartbeats, must also be created.

<p>

These files are best created by the <b>owl-initsensor</b> command, but they
may also be created manually.  If they are created manually, you <b>must</b>
use the names and organization as given in the examples below.  The locations
of the directories may change (i.e., the <b>/owl/data</b> and
<b>/owl/archive</b> portions), but that's it.

<p>

For example, when adding the new sensors <b>helsinki</b> and <b>canberra</b>,
you might create the following sets of directories:

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
sensor directory<br>
data directory<br>
heartbeat file<br>
history directory<br>
archive directory<br>
<td width=50>&nbsp;

<td>
<b>/owl/data/helsinki/</b><br>
<b>/owl/data/helsinki/data/</b><br>
<b>/owl/data/helsinki/heartbeat</b><br>
<b>/owl/data/helsinki/history/</b><br>
<b>/owl/archive/helsinki/</b><br>
<td width=50>&nbsp;

<td>
<b>/owl/data/canberra/</b><br>
<b>/owl/data/canberra/data/</b><br>
<b>/owl/data/canberra/heartbeat</b><br>
<b>/owl/data/canberra/history/</b><br>
<b>/owl/archive/canberra/</b><br>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>

The archive directory must be writable by the manager's Owl user, but the
others must be writable by the manager's Owl user and the manager's web
server.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.2."></a>
<h3>4.2. Firewall Configuration</h3>

<p>

The Owl manager and the Owl sensor communicate by way of SSH and HTTP.  If the
Owl manager is protected by a firewall (either on the manager host itself or
by an enterprise-level firewall) then the firewall must be configured to allow
data to be transferred between the manager and the sensor.  The direction of
this transfer (initiated by sensor or initiated by manager) depends on the Owl
configuration.  These firewall modifications are far beyond the scope of this
document.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.3."></a>
<h3>4.3. SSH Set-up</h3>

<p>

First, you must generate a new SSH key for the manager's Owl user.

<p>

If the manager will be pulling data from the sensor, then the you must provide
the sensor administrator with your Owl user's public key.  This key will allow
<b>owl-transfer-mgr</b> to retrieve Owl sensor data.  You must generate your
key in compliance with particular key requirements (e.g., length and type)
specified by the sensor administrator.

<p>

If the sensor will be transferring data to the manager, then the sensor
administrator must provide you with the public key of their Owl sensor user.
This key will allow <b>owl-transfer</b> to pass Owl sensor data to the your
manager.  You must add this key to your <b>.ssh/authorized_keys</b> file.
The key must be generated with key characteristics (e.g., length and type)
that are acceptable to you.  See the example below.

<p>

The <b>authorized_keys</b> file restricts access to known sensor hosts and
controls where each Owl sensor's data are stored.  This file should only have
one entry per sensor, and each sensor should have a unique data directory.

<p>

Example entries (with abbreviated keys):

<pre>
    command="/usr/local/bin/rrsync /owl/data/sensor1" ssh-rsa AAAA...Qw== sensor@sensor1.example.com
    command="/usr/local/bin/rrsync /owl/data/sensor8" ssh-rsa AAAA...gM== sensor@sensor8.example.au
</pre>

The parts of the line from "ssh-rsa " to the end of the line are the public
SSH key provided by the sensor's administrator.  You will add everything
before the "ssh-rsa ", using the proper paths for <b>rrsync</b> and the
sensor's data directory.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.4."></a>
<h3>4.4. Configuration Settings</h3>

<p>

With Owl's capability of having either the sensor or the manager transfer
sensor data to the manager, there are configuration settings that must be
made to allow the transfer. These are described in the subsections below.
Regardless of how your Owl installation handles data transfer, you should
read both subsections to ensure you are making all the required settings.

<p>

It would be a good idea for you and the sensor administrator to agree on a
name for the sensor.  This isn't required, but it will probably make things
easier for you both in the long run to refer to the sensor by the same name.

<p>

The sensor name can be very generic, such as <i>sensor42</i>, <i>sensor-d</i>,
or <i>owl-us-east</i>.  It can also be very specific, such as
<i>washdc-1600-penn-ave-nw</i> or <i>cheltenham-bldg4</i>.  The intent is
to provide distinguishing information to the intended audience of the DNS
monitoring data.  You should use names that easily distinguish sensors and
are acceptable to the manager and sensor administrators.

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.4.1."></a>
<h3>4.4.1. Provide Configuration Information to Sensor Administrator</h3>

<p>

If the Owl sensor will be transferring data to the manager, then you must
provide the sensor administrator with an SSH user.  All Owl sensors may
use this single SSH user, and the data will be distinguished by the SSH
key used to connect from the sensor.

<p>

The sensor will use the heartbeat URL to provide a heartbeat to the manager.
If this is to be used, it must be set on the sensor regardless of who
initiates sensor data transfer.

<p>

The data values will be added to the sensor's configuration file.

<p>

The following example data will allow the sensor to work with the Owl manager
as expected.  These data are used, in conjunction with the <i>remote</i>
keyword, in the sensor's configuration file.

<p>

<table>

<tr>
<td valign=top>Configuration&nbsp;Field

</table>

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.4.2."></a>
<h3>4.4.2. Receive Configuration Information from Sensor Administrator</h3>

<p>

If the Owl manager will be pulling data from the sensor, then the sensor
administrator must provide you with an SSH user.  The <b>owl-transfer-mgr</b>
program will use this SSH user to copy data from the sensor.

<p>

The following data will allow the manager to connect to the Owl sensor as
expected.  These data are used, in conjunction with the <i>remote</i>
keyword, in the sensor's configuration file.

<p>

<table>

<tr>
<td valign=top>Configuration&nbsp;Field
<td valign=top width=20>&nbsp;
<td valign=top width="40%">Purpose
<td valign=top width=20>&nbsp;

</table>

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.5."></a>
<h3>4.5. Test Transfer from Sensor</h3>

<p>

At this point, you are ready to test your Owl manager.  When the sensor
administrator reaches
<a href="install-sensor-4-adding-sensor.html#ig-sensor-4.5.">section 4.5</a>
in their installation instructions, both sensor and manager are ready to test
the data transfer.

<p>

Coordinate with the sensor administrator to test data transfer.  The sensor
administrator must put a data file (of any sort, it doesn't have to be an Owl
data file) in their data directory.  If the manager will be transferring data,
you must run <b>owl-transfer-mgr</b> to attempt to retrieve the test file.  If
the sensor will be transferring data, the sensor administrator must run
<b>owl-transfer</b> to attempt to retrieve the test file.  After the transfer
command <i>appears</i> to have transferred the file without error, you must
check that sensor's data directory on the manager to ensure the file has
arrived as expected.

<p>

Once the test file successfully appears in the new sensor's data directory,
the sensor is ready to start collecting data and transferring it to the
manager.  You must inform the sensor administrator of this, so they can start
the Owl sensor daemons.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.6."></a>
<h3>4.6. Wait for Sensor Data</h3>

<p>

The sensor should now be in the process of collecting DNS response data.
Whichever host will be transferring data must have the appropriate transfer
daemon executing.  You must now wait for sensor data to show up in the
sensor's data directory.  The time this takes will depend on how frequently
the data is transferred to the manager.  This is set in the configuration
file.

<p>

You will know when the sensor is transferring data because the new sensor's
data directory will start holding files whose names reflect the queries you
are expecting.  You may proceed when you have found files for all the
queries the sensor will be performing.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.7."></a>
<h3>4.7. Build Nagios Sensor Objects</h3>

<p>

Once all the sensor's data directory contains files for all the queries
expected from the new sensor, Nagios objects must be built for those queries.
This may be done automatically using the <b>owl-newsensor</b> command.
A file containing these Nagios objects must be created, and it will be
added to the Nagios environment in
<a href="install-manager-4-adding-sensor.html#ig-manager-4.8.1.">section 4.8.1</a>.

<p>

<b>owl-newsensor</b> can be used like this to create the Nagios objects:

<pre>
    $ owl-newsensor -out sensor8.cfg /owl/data/sensor8/data
</pre>

<p>

Passing <b>owl-newsensor</b> the <i>-heartbeat</i> option will cause an
object to be created that will allow Nagios to display heartbeat information
about the new sensor.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.8."></a>
<h3>4.8. Nagios Modifications</h3>

<p>

Several Nagios configuration files must be modified to account for the new
sensor.  These changes will allow Nagios to start reporting current status
of the new sensor as well as saving historical data to be used in graphing.

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.8.1."></a>
<h3>4.8.1. <b>nagios.cfg</b></h3>

<p>

The following modifications must be made to the <b>nagios.cfg</b> file to
prepare Nagios for monitoring Owl sensor data.

<ul>

<li>Add the following entries to <b>nagios.cfg</b>:

<pre>
    cfg_file=/owl/nagios/etc/objects/owl-contacts.cfg
    cfg_file=/owl/nagios/etc/objects/owl-hosts.cfg
    cfg_file=/owl/nagios/etc/objects/owl-commands.cfg
    cfg_file=/owl/nagios/etc/objects/owl-services.cfg
</pre>

These files contain basic Nagios object definitions used by the Owl sensor
objects.  They should follow all the other standard <i>cfg_file</i> lines.

<p>

<li>Once Nagios object configuration files have been created for your sensors
(as described in
<a href="install-manager-4-adding-sensor.html#ig-manager-4.7.">section 4.7</a>),
<b>nagios.cfg</b> must be modified to include
the new files.  Add a new <i>cfg_file</i> entry for each of the sensor object
files.  These entries will look something like this:
<pre>
    cfg_file=/owl/nagios/etc/objects/owl-sensor21.cfg
    cfg_file=/owl/nagios/etc/objects/sensor-london.cfg
</pre>
The sensor lines should follow all four of the <i>cfg_file</i> lines listed
in the previous point.

<p>

<li>Add the following line after the sensor <i>cfg_file</i> lines described
in the previous point.
<pre>
    cfg_file=/owl/etc/objects/owl-hostgroups.cfg
</pre>
Modification of the <b>owl-hostgroups.cfg</b> file is described below.

<p>

<li>Find the <i>service_perfdata_command</i> line and change it to:
"service_perfdata_command=service-perfdata-for-owl"

<p>

<li>Find the <i>service_perfdata_file_processing_command</i> line and change
it to:  "service_perfdata_file_processing_command=service-perfdata-for-owl"

<p>

</ul>

<p>

Examples for the <i>cfg_file</i> modifications may be found in
<b>nagios.cfg-owl.mods</b> in the Owl manager distribution.

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.8.2."></a>
<h3>4.8.2. <b>owl-hostgroups.cfg</b></h3>

<p>

This file contains the "<i>DNS Response Time Sensors</i>" Nagios
<i>hostgroup</i> object that lists the Owl sensor hosts.  All your Owl
sensors should be listed in the "<i>DNS Response Time Sensors</i>" object.

<p>

<ul>

<li>Add the new sensor name to the <i>members</i> field in the "<i>DNS Response
Time Sensors</i>" object.  The names must be separated by commas.

</ul>

<p>

You may add your own <i>hostgroup</i> objects to this file.  Use the "<i>DNS
Response Time Sensors</i>" object as a guide to create custom groups.  This
can be used, for example, to group all the sensors in a geographical region
or those that are running a particular operating system.  The <i>hostgroup</i>
object allows you to group a set of hosts in a manner that makes sense for
your purposes.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.9."></a>
<h3>4.9. Graphing Modifications</h3>

<p>

The new sensor's data must be made available to the <b>drraw.cgi</b> script.
To do this, the new sensor's data sources must be added to the <i>%datadirs</i>
hash in the <b>drraw.conf</b> file.
See <a href="install-manager-2-installation.html#ig-manager-2.1.2.4.">2.1.2.4.</a>&nbsp;<b>drraw.cgi</b>
for more details.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-4.10."></a>
<h3>4.10. Restart Nagios</h3>

<p>

Nagios must be restarted in order for it to see your new sensor's objects.

<p>

Prior to the restart, verify that your object modifications won't cause
a problem for Nagios.  Execute this command (assuming you are in the
directory containing the Nagios files):

<pre>
    $ nagios -v nagios.cfg
</pre>

It will read the configuration files and ensure they all look okay.
If there are problems, they must be resolved before Nagios is started.

<p>

Once the Nagios configuration file is validated and without problems, Nagios
may be restarted:

<pre>
    $ nagios stop
    $ nagios start
</pre>

<p>

It will probably take several minutes for Nagios to check all its services.
Clicking on the "Services" link in the left-hand sidebar will bring up the
configured services and you can watch the status of your new sensor.
