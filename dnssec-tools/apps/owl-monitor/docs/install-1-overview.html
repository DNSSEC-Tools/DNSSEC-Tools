<!------------------------------------------------------------>

The Owl Monitoring System has a conceptually simple method of operations.
There is a manager host and a set of sensor hosts.  The sensors periodically
make a set of DNS queries and time how long it takes to get a response.  The
response times are saved to data files.  After a certain amount of time, the
sensor transfers the data files to the manager host.  The manager transfers
the data into a monitoring package, which allows easy display of the data.

<p>

Below is a diagram of the flow of Owl sensor data through two Owl monitoring
installations.

<p>

Take note of the following:

<ul>
<li>There are three distinct administrative domains, two of which have Owl
managers.
<li>Owl Manager 1 receives sensor data from all three domains.
<li>Owl Manager 2 receives sensor data from itself and one other domain.
<li>Domain 1's sensors do not provide data to other domains.
<li>Domain 2 contains an Owl sensor, but not an Owl manager. 
<li>Owl sensors in the domains 2 and 3 provide data to Owl managers outside
of their own domain.
<li>Owl sensors can query multiple name servers.
</ul>

(Domains in this example are defining administrative control and are <u>not</u>
DNS domains.)

<p>

The remainder of this section provides a little more information on the
components that make up the sensor and manager software.

<p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->

<a name="1.1."></a>
<h3>1.1. Owl Sensor Overview</h3>

<p>

An Owl sensor makes timed DNS queries and records the time required for a
response.  The sensor transfers the response times to the Owl manager after
it has amassed a small collection of responses.   The three primary programs
that handle these tasks are described below.

<p>

The Owl sensor's actions are controlled by a configuration file.  This file
defines the queries that must be performed, how often the queries must
happen, how frequently the response data files are transferred to the
manager, data and logging information, and other required information.

<p>

The <b>owl-dnstimer</b> program performs periodic DNS lookups, as specified by
the configuration file.  These lookups are timed so that the sensor can record
how long it took to make a particular request.  The configuration parameters
used by <b>owl-dnstimer</b> include the nameserver to query, the target zone
to query about, the type of DNS record, and the frequency of queries.

<p>

The timing data are periodically transferred to the manager by the
<b>owl-transfer</b> program.  The transfers are performed using <b>rsync</b>
over an <b>ssh</b> connection.  The sensor host must be able to do a
password-less <b>ssh</b> into the manager host.  The frequency of transfers
is defined in the configuration file.  Choosing the transfer frequency is a
trade-off between lower impact on the sensor, manager, and network (less
frequent) and lower latency of data display on the manager (more frequent.)

<p>

The <b>owl-sensord</b> program is an optional controller for <b>owl-dnstimer</b>
and <b>owl-transfer</b>.  If used, it will run these daemons and restart them
if they stop.  If one of the daemons tries to restart too often in too short
a time, then <b>owl-sensord</b> will warn an administrator (via email) and
temporarily stop trying to execute the program.  <b>owl-sensord</b> is not
required to run <b>owl-dnstimer</b> and <b>owl-transfer</b>; the Owl sensor
can run fine without it.  However, it provides a convenient way to keep them
running.

<p>

As part of the installation process, you must decide whether you will run the
Owl sensor using the <b>owl-sensord</b> daemon to control execution or if you
will run <b>owl-dnstimer</b> and <b>owl-transfer</b> directly.

<p>

The Owl sensor has a number of programs for administrative support.  Most
of these are not required, but they assist in sensor administration.  In
particular, the <b>owl-dataarch</b> and <b>owl-heartbeat</b> programs are
intended to run as <b>cron</b> jobs.  <b>owl-dataarch</b> moves "old" sensor
data into an archive directory, in order to keep <b>owl-transfer</b>'s
execution from bogging down (within <b>rsync</b>) as the data collection
grows.  The <b>owl-heartbeat</b> program periodically touches a webpage hosted
on the Owl manager, in order to let the manager know that the sensor host is
still running.  <b>owl-heartbeat</b> is not critical and can be left off, but
<b>owl-dataarch</b> is essential.  There are a few others available; see
<a href="install-7-commands.html#7.1">section 7.1</a> for a brief description
of all the Owl sensor commands.

<p>

<h3>1.2. Owl Manager Overview</h3>

<p>

The Owl manager's purpose is to receive sensor data and make it available for
display.  The majority of the Owl manager software is third-party packages,
and the Owl software provides the "glue" that allows the Owl sensor data to
work with those packages.  In particular, Owl provides data to the Nagios
monitoring system, which then displays the data.

<p>

From the perspective of the sensor/manager interaction, the manager is
passive.  The Owl sensors transfer their data to the manager as the sensors
see fit.  The Owl sensors may report to managers that are under separate
administrative control.  A particular installation of the Owl Monitoring
System may use multiple manager hosts, but this document assumes that there
is only one.

<p>

The are two groups of "glue" programs that Owl uses to interface with
Nagios.  The <b>owl-dnswatch</b> and <b>owl-perfdata</b> inject Owl
sensor DNS response data into Nagios for display and graphing.  The
<b>owl-sensor-heartbeat.cgi</b> and <b>owl-stethoscope</b> programs
insert Owl "heartbeat" data into Nagios so it can track availability
of the Owl sensors.

<p>

The Owl manager also has a number of programs for administrative support.
Most of these are not required, but they assist in manager administration.
In particular, the <b>owl-archdata</b> and <b>owl-monthly</b> programs are
intended to run as <b>cron</b> jobs.  <b>owl-archdata</b> moves "old" sensor
data into an archive directory, in order to keep data transfer from the sensor
from bogging down as the data collection grows.  The <b>owl-monthly</b>
program archives the previous month's sensor data into a compressed tarfile.
<b>owl-newsensor</b> and <b>owl-initsensor</b> assist in setting up the
manager for a new sensor.  There are a few others available; see <a
href="install-7-commands.html#7.2">section 7.2</a> for a brief description
of all the Owl manager commands.

<p>

The following third-party software packages are used in with this distribution
of the Owl Monitoring System.  These packages must be installed on the manager:

<p>

<table>
<tr><td width=40>&nbsp;<td width=150><li>Nagios<td>Monitoring system.
<tr><td>&nbsp;<td><li>Nagios plugins<td>Monitoring system.
<tr><td>&nbsp;<td><li><b>nagiosgraph</b><td>Provides graphing for Nagios.
<tr><td>&nbsp;<td><li><b>rrdtool</b><td>Database tool for use by <b>nagiosgraph</b>.
<tr><td>&nbsp;<td><li><b>drraw.cgi</b><td>Draws graphs for <b>nagiosgraph</b> of data stored by <b>rrdtool</b>.
</table>

<p>

Instructions are given in this document for integrating these packages with
the Owl software.  It would be for the best to read the installation
instructions below for each package <i>prior</i> to installing them.

<p>

If desired, different management, graphing, and database tools may be used
instead of those listed above.  Integrating the Owl manager software with
other packages is beyond the scope of this document.

<p>

David Josephsen's <u>Building a Monitoring Infrastructure with Nagios</u>
is very helpful for understanding Nagios and how the various pieces work
together.  If you're going to be running a Nagios monitor, you would be
doing yourself a favor to read this book.

<h3>1.3. Data Retention on Owl Hosts</h3>

<p>

Owl sensors generate a large amount of DNS response data.  For example,
a sensor running six queries, once a minute each, generated roughly 34MB
of data.  You may or may not want to retain any of this data.  The Owl
manager's <b>rrdtool</b> databases can be rebuilt (or even built with
different parameters) using these data files.

<p>

On both the Owl manager and the Owl sensors, sensor data are stored in
a data directory.  After a few days, the data files are moved to a data
archive directory.  A full month's data files will be collapsed into a
compressed format.

<p>

The Owl Monitoring System provides tools that assist with managing Owl
sensor data.  After the data have been moved into the data archive,
the Owl Monitoring System has no further need of the old data; it may
be retained or deleted.  Each installation must decide their own data
retention policy.
