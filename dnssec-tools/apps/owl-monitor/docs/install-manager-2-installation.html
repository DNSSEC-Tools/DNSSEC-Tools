<p>

This section gives installation procedures for setting up the Owl Monitoring
software on manager hosts.  There are two sections, an installation section
and a configuration section.  The installation instructions discuss software
installation of Owl software and supporting third-party software packages.
System configuration is also detailed in this section, but only for
non-Owl-specific configuration.  There are a number of Owl-specific
configuration actions that must be performed and these are detailed in <a
href="install-manager-4-adding-sensor.html">section 4</a>.

<p>

The Owl manager <b>requires</b> Perl.  You must install it on your system
if it isn't already available.

<p>


<!------------------------------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1."></a>
<h3>2.1. Manager Installation</h3>

The basic Owl manager configuration consists of the Owl software and the
Nagios monitoring system.  This configuration allows for monitoring of current
sensor status, but does not provide any view into past monitoring data.  In
order to get the historical view, especially as provided by a graphing
capability, several additional software packages must be installed on the
manager.  Since the historical view provides a great deal of useful
information, these instructions will assume that you will be installing the
additional software.

<p>

It is possible (and not too difficult) to run multiple instances of the
third-party software packages (e.g., Nagios, <b>nagiosgraph</b>) on a single
host, but care must be taken when configuring, building, and installing the
software.  Without careful work, an existing installation may be overwritten
by a later installation.  These instructions assume that only one instance of
each package will be installed on the manager host.

<p>

Below is a diagram of the flow of Owl sensor data on the Owl manager.  The
details may not make sense at this stage, but this will show how the various
pieces fit together.

<p>

<center>
<img src="owl-manager-data.png">
</center>

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.1."></a>
<h3>2.1.1. Preparatory Steps</h3>

Several actions must be taken on the manager host to prepare it for installing
the required software.  These steps are listed below.  During the installation
procedures, don't be shy about backing up things; it might not be necessary,
but better safe than sorry.

<p>

<ul>

<li>It is advisable to run a backup of your system before starting.  Depending
on your level of paranoia, it couldn't hurt to run an incremental backup after
completing each step of the installation.

<p>

<li>An unprivileged user account must be created for the Owl manager software.
An existing account may be used, but it would probably be best to use a new
account as this will segregate files and processes from existing users.  The
user's name and group are not required to be any particular values.

<p>

You may want to create two unprivileged users for use by the Owl manager.
One would run the various Owl commands, and the other would be used for
sensor data transfers (in the case that the sensor is to initiate transfers.)
The first user will need <i>rwx</i> permission to all the Owl directories and
files.  The second user will need to be able to write data into the Owl data
directories.

<p>

In the following instructions, it is assumed that a single user will created
for the Owl manager and it will be referred to as the Owl User.

<p>

<li>SSH utilities and a web server must be installed on the manager host.
These instructions assume that the OpenSSH and the Apache web server will be
used.  Others may be used instead, but the you must determine the appropriate
commands and options to use.  Apache support is included in Nagios.

<p>

<li>Install the <b>rrsync</b> utility.  This is a front-end to <b>rsync</b> that restricts the locations to which <b>rsync</b> may copy data.  This tool is available here:  <b>http://ftp.samba.org/pub/unpacked/rsync/support/rrsync</b>

<p>

<li>Create the directories required for each sensor.  There must be a data
repository and a data archive.  Each sensor will have their own subdirectory
in the repository and in the archive.  There must be a <b>data</b> and a
<b>history</b> directory within each sensor's repository directory.

<p>

The following is a possible set of directories:
<table>
<tr><td width=40>&nbsp;<td><b>/owl/data</b><td>top-level data repository
<tr><td width=40>&nbsp;<td><b>/owl/old.data</b><td>top-level data archive
<tr><td width=40>&nbsp;<td><b>/owl/data/sensor-portland/dnstimer</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<td>sensor-portland's DNS timer-data directory
<tr><td width=40>&nbsp;<td><b>/owl/data/sensor-portland/history</b><td>sensor-portland's monitoring history (for Nagios)
<tr><td width=40>&nbsp;<td><b>/owl/old.data/sensor-portland</b><td>sensor-portland's data archive
<tr><td width=40>&nbsp;<td><b>/owl/data/sensor-oslo/dnstimer</b><td>sensor-oslo's DNS timer-data directory
<tr><td width=40>&nbsp;<td><b>/owl/data/sensor-oslo/history</b><td>sensor-oslo's monitoring history (for Nagios)
<tr><td width=40>&nbsp;<td><b>/owl/old.data/sensor-oslo</b><td>sensor-oslo's data archive
</table>

<p>

<li>Create an SSH key for the Owl user.  This is commonly done with the
<b>ssh-keygen</b> command.

<p>

<li>Consider the users you want to access your Owl monitor, as well as the
types of access they should be allowed.  These users will be added to the
Owl-specific password file used by Apache and the users and access rights
will be added to a Nagios configuration file.  These users are web-based
users only, and are not (necessarily) related to users on the Owl manager
host.

<p>

<li>Install the software as described in the following sections.  The Owl
software will be installed <i>after</i> all the third-party software, since
some of the Owl software will be installed in directories created by the
third-party software.

<p>

</ul>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.2."></a>
<h3>2.1.2. Installing Third-Party Software</h3>

The third-party software packages should be built and installed as specified
by each package.  Owl-specific notes for each will be given below.  While many
of these packages are available as pre-built distributions, configuring and
building them yourself will provide for additional control that may be useful.
This includes the installation location and the user and group that will be
used for executing the commands.

<p>

Nagios, along with a web server, should be installed such that they will be
restarted at system boot time.

<p>

This table shows the most recent software versions that were tested with the
Owl Monitor. 
<table>

</table>

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.2.1."></a>
<h3>2.1.2.1. Nagios Core and Plugins</h3>

If building Nagios Core and Nagios Plugins from source, it is recommended that
the <b>configure</b> command be given arguments that will allow specification
of the installation-path prefix, the Nagios user, and the Nagios group.  A
possible command line could be:

<pre>
    $ ./configure --with-command-group --prefix=/owl --with-nagios-user=owl-monitor --with-nagios-group=owl-monitor
</pre>

<p>

The same prefix, username, and groupname must be used when building Nagios
Core and Nagios Plugins.

<p>

Multiple instances of Nagios can be installed on a single machine.  This can
be useful for segregating different things being monitored.  However, you must
be careful when doing this.  In particular, even if the <i>--prefix</i> option
was given to <b>configure</b>, the "make install-init" and "make
install-webconf" commands will overwrite existing Nagios files.

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.2.2."></a>
<h3>2.1.2.2. <b>nagiosgraph</b></h3>

The <b>README</b> file for <b>nagiosgraph</b> contains instructions for
automated installation (using <b>install.pl</b>) and for manual installation.
You should read this file and decide which method you want to use.

<p>

If you choose the manual installation, you may skip most of this section and
pick up at the discussion of the <b>map</b> file.

<p>

If you choose to install with <b>install.pl</b>, you must know that it looks
like several of the steps are not performed by the script.  After running
<b>install.pl</b> you must verify that the manual steps from "Restart nagios"
to the end have actually been taken.

<p>

<b>install.pl</b> will configure the package, install its files in the
appropriate places, and modify Nagios and <b>httpd</b> files as needed.
A variety of options allow for site-specific installation layouts.  In
addition, you will be prompted for many directory and file names prior to
<b>install.pl</b> completing its work.  If it can't find one or another file
that it must update, then at the end of execution it will provide a set of
steps that you must manually perform in order to complete the installation.

<p>

The <i>--dry-run</i> option will show you what <b>install.pl</b> would do, so
that you may verify where things are being copied.  It isn't required, but it
wouldn't be a bad idea to use this option prior to the actual install.

<p>

One thing <b>install.pl</b> is likely to say is that you must add a Nagios
command file.  This file probably already exists, and you must find it.  It
is likely to be called something like <b>commands.cfg</b> and be located in
the <b>etc/objects</b> directory in your Nagios installation.  Check names
carefully when making this modification, as <b>commands.cfg</b> already has
a <i>process-service-perfdata</i> command and <b>install.pl</b> will have
you add a <i>process-service-perfdata-by-nagiosgraph</i> command.

<p>

<b>install.pl</b> logs all its actions, including the manual-intervention
actions, in the <b>install-log</b> file.  Unfortunately, the command line is
not recorded in the log file, so it might be useful to save that somewhere
yourself.

<p>

I have used this command to successfully install <b>nagiosgraph</b>:

<pre>
    $ install.pl --prefix /owl/nagiosgraph --nagios-user owl-manager --nagios-cgi-url /nagios-owl/cgi-bin \
    --nagios-perfdata-file /owl/var/service-perfdata.out --log-dir /owl/var --layout standalone
</pre>

I do not let <b>install.pl</b> update the Nagios or Apache configurations,
which it will prompt for; I prefer to make those modifications myself.
Refer to the <b>install-log</b> file to see what remains to be done.

<p>

The <b>README</b> file contains steps for manual installation and it looks
like several of the steps are not performed by <b>install.pl</b>.  If you use
<b>install.pl</b> to install <b>nagiosgraph</b>, verify that the manual steps
from "Restart nagios" to the end have actually been taken.

<p>

You may have to manually copy the <b>nagiosgraph.ssi</b> file into place.
This file is in <b>.../nagiosgraph/examples/nagiosgraph.ssi</b> and it
should be copied into your equivalent of <b>/owl/share/nagiosgraph.ssi</b>.

<p>

Before <b>nagiosgraph</b> can be used by the Owl manager, the <b>map</b>
file must be modified to recognize data from the Owl plugins for Nagios.
The required modifications are discussed in
<a href="install-manager-2-installation.html#ig-manager-2.2.7.">section 2.2.7</a>.

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.2.3."></a>
<h3>2.1.2.3. <b>rrdtool</b></h3>

No Owl-specific configuration or actions were required for building and
installing <b>rrdtool</b>.

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.2.4."></a>
<h3>2.1.2.4. <b>drraw.cgi</b></h3>

To install <b>drraw.cgi</b>, copy the <b>drraw.cgi</b> and the
<b>drraw.conf</b> files into the Nagios <b>sbin/</b> directory.  So, if you
have installed Nagios in <b>/owl/nagios</b>, then you should copy the two
<b>drraw</b> files into <b>/owl/nagios/sbin</b>.

<p>

The <b>drraw.conf</b> must be edited for this installation.  Some of these
edits are required and some are optional.  Each will be marked as to whether
or not you must make the change.  This file is a Perl file, so the
configuration values are set according to Perl's language rules.

<p>

<ul>

<li>Set the <i>$title</i> variable if you don't want the default page title
in the Nagios-displayed graphing pages.
<br><i>(optional)</i>

<p>

<li>Set the <i>%datadirs</i> variable to hold the paths to your sensors' RRD
databases.  There are two fields required for each entry.  The first is the
path to that sensor's database files, and should not have a terminating
slash.  The second is a name by which those databases will be identified when
defining new graphs.

<pre>
    '/owl/nagiosgraph/var/rrd/sensor1%20h-root%20foo.com%20A'  => '[Kyoto H foo A]',
    '/owl/nagiosgraph/var/rrd/sensor1%20h-root%20foo.com%20NS' => '[Kyoto H foo NS]',
    '/owl/nagiosgraph/var/rrd/sensor5%20h-root%20foo.com%20A'  => '[Cairo H foo A]',
</pre>

The identifier should be unique for each database directory.
<br><i>(required)</i>

<p>

<li>Set the <i>vrefresh</i> variable for the number of seconds the graph
viewer will wait before automatically refreshing its display.
<br><i>(optional)</i>

<p>

<li>Set the <i>drefresh</i> variable for the number of seconds the dashboard
viewer will wait before automatically refreshing its display.
<br><i>(optional)</i>

<p>

<li>Set the <i>@dv_def</i>, @<i>dv_name</i>, and @<i>dv_secs</i> array
variables for the graphs that will be generated each time a predefined graph
is displayed.  These are time based values and a particular element of one
array is directly related to that same element in the other arrays.

<p>

The <i>@dv_def</i> array is used to select data from the database.
The <i>@dv_name</i> array is used to provide titles for each graph.
The <i>@dv_secs</i> array is used to provide the count of seconds for
each graph.

<p>

The following example values show the relation between the three arrays.
<pre>
    @dv_def  = ( 'end - 15 minutes', 'end - 60 minutes', 'end - 4 hours',
		 'end - 12 hours',   'end - 24 hours',   'end - 1 week' ,
		 'end - 1 month',    'end - 1 year');

    @dv_name = (
	'Past&nbsp;15&nbsp;Minutes',
	'Past&nbsp;60&nbsp;Minutes',
	'Past&nbsp;4&nbsp;Hours',
	'Past&nbsp;12&nbsp;hours',
	'Past&nbsp;24&nbsp;Hours',
	'Past&nbsp;Week',
	'Past&nbsp;Month',
	'Past&nbsp;Year'
    );

    @dv_secs = ( 900, 3600, 14400, 43200, 86400, 604800, 2419200, 31536000 );
</pre>
<i>(optional)</i>

<p>

<li>The <i>$saved_dir</i> variable defines where definitions for your
predefined graphs will be stored.  It must be set to match your path
configuration and it must exist and be writable by the web server.
It might be something like:

<pre>
    $saved_dir = '/owl/nagios/var/drraw/saved';
</pre>
<i>(required)</i>

<p>

<li>The <i>$tmp_dir</i> variable defines where cached graphing file will be
stored until they time out and are deleted.  It must be set to match your path
configuration and it must exist and be writable by the web server.  It might
be something like:

<pre>
    $tmp_dir = '/owl/nagios/var/drraw/tmp';
</pre>
<i>(required)</i>

<p>

<li>The <i>$ERRLOG</i> variable defines where graphing errors will be logged.
It must be set to match your path configuration and it must exist and be
writable by the web server.  It might be something like:

<pre>
    $ERRLOG = '/owl/nagios/var/drraw/errors.log';
</pre>
<i>(required)</i>

<p>

</ul>

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.2.5."></a>
<h3>2.1.2.5. Perl modules</h3>

There is a set of Perl modules required by the Owl manager and the third-party
software packages.  Some of the software packages may install these packages
themselves, but you must ensure that these are available.  These should be
available through CPAN.

<p>

Modules required by the Owl manager:
<ul>
<li>Cwd.pm
<li>Fcntl.pm
<li>File::Path.pm
<li>Getopt::Long.pm
<li>Time::Local.pm
</ul>

<p>

It is likely that some of the third-party software may require other Perl
modules.  The installation documentation or process <i>should</i> inform you
of what must be installed on your system.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.3."></a>
<h3>2.1.3. Installing the Owl Monitor Software</h3>

There is a small amount of manager-specific software in the Owl Monitor.  Most
of the work on the manager is performed by Nagios and the other third-party
software.  The Owl Monitor software on the manager host consists of two Nagios
plugins that will interpret Owl sensor data for Nagios and add Owl sensor data
to graphing databases.  There is also a small number of administrator
programs for managing the large amounts of Owl sensor data.

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.3.1."></a>
<h3>2.1.3.1. Unpacking the Owl Monitor Software</h3>

The Owl Monitor software comes in a <b>bzip2</b>'d <b>tar</b> file.  In most
modern Unix systems, this can be unpacked with this command:

<pre>
        $ tar xzf owl-monitor.tar.gz
</pre>

This command unpacks the Owl distribution in the current directory.  This
can be unpacked anywhere you want, but it is a good idea to do it in the Owl
manager's home directory.

<p>

Most of the Owl commands will be in the <b>owl-manager/bin</b> directory.
These commands can stay in that directory or be moved elsewhere.  If they
remain in their own directory, it would be helpful to add the directory
to your shell's path.

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.3.2."></a>
<h3>2.1.3.2. <b>owl-dnswatch</b></h3>

The <b>owl-dnswatch</b> command is a Nagios plugin that reads Owl monitoring
data and reports the latest results to Nagios.  Each execution of
<b>owl-dnswatch</b> requires an Owl sensor name, a target host, a DNS server,
and a DNS query type.  The appropriate monitor datafile is consulted based on
those inputs.  The following actions must be taken to install
<b>owl-dnswatch</b>.

<p>

<ul>

<li>Set the <i>$OWLDATA</i> value in <b>owl-dnswatch</b> to the top-level
directory that holds the Owl monitoring data.  This path will depend on
your installation hierarchy, but it will likely look something like:

<pre>
        my $OWLDATA = "/owl/data";
</pre>

<p>

<li>Copy <b>owl-dnswatch</b> to the Nagios plugin directory.  This directory
is probably something like <b>/owl/nagios/libexec</b>.

<p>

</ul>

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.3.3."></a>
<h3>2.1.3.3. <b>owl-perfdata</b></h3>

The <b>owl-perfdata</b> command is a Nagios plugin that acts as a front-end
for inserting Owl monitoring data into an RRD database.  These databases are
used for graphing the monitoring data.  The following actions must be taken
to install <b>owl-perfdata</b>.

<ul>

<li>Set the <i>$GRAPHINSERT</i> value in <b>owl-perfdata</b> to the path
to the <b>insert.pl</b> command.  This path will depend on where you have
installed <b>nagiosgraph</b>, but it will likely look something like:

<pre>
        my $GRAPHINSERT = "/owl/nagiosgraph/bin/insert.pl";
</pre>

<p>

<li>Copy <b>owl-perfdata</b> to the Nagios plugin directory.  This directory
is probably something like <b>/owl/nagios/libexec</b>.

<p>

</ul>

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.3.4."></a>
<h3>2.1.3.4. <b>owl-newsensor</b></h3>

There are a set of Nagios objects that must be created for each Owl
sensor.  Once the Owl manager has sensor data files in its data directory,
the <b>owl-newsensor</b> program can be used to create these objects.
The actions required for this are described in
<a href="install-manager-4-adding-sensor.html#ig-manager-4.7.">section 4.7</a>.

<p>

No local modifications are required for <b>owl-newsensor</b>.

<p>

Copy <b>owl-newsensor</b> to a directory which will be its home.
This could be anything that is convenient for you; e.g., <b>/usr/bin</b>,
<b>/usr/local/bin</b>, <b>~/mystuff</b>, or <b>/owl/scripts</b>.

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.3.5."></a>
<h3>2.1.3.5. <b>owl-transfer-mgr</b></h3>

If the Owl manager transfers data from a sensor, it will use the
<b>owl-transfer-mgr</b> to retrieve the data.

<p>

No local modifications are required for <b>owl-newsensor</b>.

<p>

<!------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.1.3.6."></a>
<h3>2.1.3.6. Data-Archiving Programs</h3>

The following programs assist the administrator with managing the large amount
of Owl monitoring data that accumulates on the Owl manager host.  These
programs work together to create a two-stage archival process.  It is helpful
to have <b>cron</b> run these programs, though this is not essential.

<p>

The first stage of the archive process moves old data from the sensor's data
directory to the sensor's archive directory.  Data is considered old if the
file's timestamp (in its name) is older than two days.  This part of the data
archiving should be performed once per day, depending on how frequently the
sensors perform their own data archiving.

<p>

The second stage of the archive process combines a month's worth of sensor
data into a single compressed tarfile.  This should be performed several days
after the end of the previous month.

<p>

The Owl data-archival programs assume that all sensor data are stored in a
common directory and all the archived data are stored in a common directory.
They will segregate data by sensor in order to prevent it from getting mixed
together.  For example, when handling data for the sensors <b>dresden</b> and
<b>kvothe</b>, these programs might expect the following directories to exist:

<p>

<pre>
    /owl/data/dresden
    /owl/data/kvothe
    /owl/data-archive/dresden
    /owl/data-archive/kvothe
</pre>

<p>

This first set of programs will archive data for all the sensors that report
to an Owl manager.  They must be told where the sensor data are stored and
where the data archive is kept.

<ul>

<li><b>owl-archdata</b> - Archives data for all sensors without having to name
them explicitly.  The sensors in the given data directory will be archived.
The data are stored in year-month subdirectories in the sensor's archive.
<b>owl-archdata</b> is used in the first stage of the archival process.

<p>

<li><b>owl-monthly</b> - Archives all sensors' archived data in a compressed
tarfile, in order to minimize space taken by the archive.  The tarfiles are
stored in another subdirectory, divided by year.
<b>owl-monthly</b> is used in the second stage of the archival process.

<p>

</ul>

<p>

This second set of programs will archive data for a single sensor that reports
to an Owl manager.  They must be told where the sensor data are stored and
where the data archive is kept.

<ul>
<li><b>owl-dataarch-mgr</b> - Archives data for a single sensor.  This is
intended to be run by <b>owl-archdata</b>, and it is a slightly modified
version of the Owl sensor's <b>owl-dataarch</b> utility.

<p>

<li><b>owl-archold</b> - Archives a sensor's archive data in a compressed
tarfile.  This is intended to be run by <b>owl-monthly</b>.  The Owl manager's
version of <b>owl-archold</b> is exactly same as the Owl sensor's utility of
the same name.

<p>

</ul>

<p>

More information about each of these programs is available in their man pages.

<p>

Copy these archiving programs to a directory which will be their home.
This could be anything that is convenient for you; e.g., <b>/usr/bin</b>,
<b>/usr/local/bin</b>, <b>~/mystuff</b>, or <b>/owl/scripts</b>.

<h3>2.2. Modifying Configuration Files</h3>

Several files must be modified in order to provide Nagios monitoring and
graphing.  These files belong to Nagios, Apache, and <b>nagiosgraph</b>.
This section describes the required modifications.  These modifications
do not provide any monitoring of Owl sensor data; further steps to supply
that functionality will be given later.

<p>

In the basic Nagios installation, <b>/nagios/etc</b> holds sample
configuration files, which can be modified for use.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.2.1."></a>
<h3>2.2.1. Save Files!</h3>

Before starting to modify any existing file -- e.g., Nagios object files and
Apache configuration files -- it would be a <i>very</i> good idea to make a
back-up copy of the files.  This will provide reference copies of the files
in case they might be needed later.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.2.2."></a>
<h3>2.2.2. <b>nagios.cfg</b> (Nagios)</h3>

This file is the primary configuration file for Nagios.  There are quite a
few changes that must be made to this file.  The modifications listed in this
section will not incorporate monitoring of Owl sensor data.  That will be
described in
<a href="install-manager-4-adding-sensor.html#ig-manager-4.8.1.">section 4.8.1</a>.

<p>

The various configuration parameters for Nagios could be included in a small
number of files, but the standard arrangement groups the parameters into
separate files.  The <b>nagios.cfg</b> file is the primary configuration file
for Nagios, and at run-time it acts as the focal point to collect the disparate
configuration files for the Nagios daemon.

<p>

A <i>cfg_file</i> line is used to tell Nagios to include the specified line.
Adding or deleting these lines will control which files are included in the
Nagios configuration.

<p>

As a result of the Nagios build and installation process, the <b>nagios.cfg</b>
file should be mostly configured already.  The Nagios configuration file is
well-documented, so figuring out how to adjust its fields shouldn't be too
difficult.  There are a few things that must be done to prepare it for Owl
monitoring.  These directions assume that Owl monitoring is the only
monitoring that will be performed by this installation.

<ul>

<p>

<li>Make sure these <i>cfg_file</i> lines are deleted or commented out:
<ul>
<li><b>localhost.cfg</b>
<li><b>printer.cfg</b>
<li><b>switch.cfg</b>
<li><b>windows.cfg</b>
</ul>
(This is not strictly necessary.  These files may provide some monitoring
information that you would find useful.)

<p>

</ul>

To allow for graphing of monitoring results, several performance-processing
fields must be set in <b>nagios.cfg</b>.  Unless otherwise stated, do not
include the double quotes when setting these fields.

<ul>

<li>Find the <i>process_performance_data</i> line and change it to:
"process_performance_data=1"

<p>

<li>Find the <i>service_perfdata_file</i> line and change it to:
"service_perfdata_file=/owl/var/service-perfdata.out"

<p>

<li>Add this line:  "service_perfdata_file_template=$LASTSERVICECHECK$||$HOSTNAME$||$SERVICEDESC$
||$SERVICEOUTPUT$||$SERVICEPERFDATA$"

<br>

(This line was split to accomodate document formatting.  Add it as a single,
unbroken line without any spaces or newlines.)

<p>

<li>Find the <i>service_perfdata_file_mode</i> line and change it to:
"service_perfdata_file_mode=a"

<p>

<li>Add this line:  "service_perfdata_file_processing_interval=30"

</ul>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.2.3."></a>
<h3>2.2.3. <b>cgi.cfg</b> (Nagios)</h3>

This is the configuration file for CGI scripts run by Nagios.  Most of it is
set up during the Nagios configuration process.  The following things must be
set to ensure your installation's needs are met.

<ul>

<li>The <i>url_html_path</i> field contains the path portion of the URL
for the Nagios monitor.  For example, if the desired URL to reach your
Nagios monitor is <b>http://www.example.com/owl-dns-monitor</b>, then
<i>url_html_path</i> must be set to <b>/owl-dns-monitor</b>.
Check this field to ensure it is set as required.

<p>

<li>The <b>cgi.cfg</b> file allows you to specify different types of
information and actions that can be taken by different users.  The
<i>authorized_for_</i> values may be set for multiple users.  The user
names are those in the <b>htpasswd.users</b> file.

</ul>

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.2.4."></a>
<h3>2.2.4. <b>resource.cfg</b> (Nagios)</h3>

Ensure USER1 points to the plugins directory.  This should be something
like <b>/owl/libexec</b>.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.2.5."></a>
<h3>2.2.5. <b>share/config.inc.php</b> (Nagios)</h3>

<p>

Nagios uses this file to hold a small amount of file-location data.  
The following actions must be taken:

<ul>

<li>Ensure that has the correct path for the <i>$cfg[]</i> fields.  If your
configuration doesn't use the default paths, this may not be set properly.
<p>

<li>Add an entry for the <i>$cfg['ng_cgi_base_url']</i> field to be set to
the path of the <b>nagiosgraph</b> CGI directory.  This will depend on how
you installed <b>nagiosgraph</b>, and should look something like this:
<pre>
    $cfg['ng_cgi_base_url']='/nagiosgraph/cgi-bin';
    $cfg['ng_cgi_base_url']='/nagiosgraph-owl/cgi-bin';
</pre>
<p>

</ul>

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.2.6."></a>
<h3>2.2.6. <b>nagiosgraph.conf</b> (nagiosgraph)</h3>

<p>

This is the configuration file for Nagiosgraph.  Several settings must be
checked and some Owl-specific setting copied in.  The following actions
must be taken:

<ul>

<p>

<li>Copy the contents of <b>ng-owl-conf</b> After the lines setting
<i>xffs</i>.  These are reasonable values, but don't change them unless
you know what you're doing.
<p>

<li>Ensure that <i>nagiosgraphcgiurl</i> path points to the appropriate
directory, as defined by your web server's configuration.
<p>

<li>Ensure that <i>javascript</i> path points to the appropriate
directory, as defined by your web server's configuration.
<p>

<li>Ensure that <i>stylesheet</i> path points to the appropriate
directory, as defined by your web server's configuration.
<p>

</ul>

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.2.7."></a>
<h3>2.2.7. <b>map</b> (nagiosgraph)</h3>

<p>

<b>nagiosgraph</b> uses a file of data definitions that describe how to
extract data from Nagios plugins and how to handle the extracted data.
The file is a collection of Perl expressions that are evaluated by
<b>nagiosgraph</b>.  This file is named something like
<b>/owl/nagiosgraph/etc/map</b>.

<p>

The Owl manager distribution contains a set of additional, Owl-specific
definitions that must be added to the <b>map</b> file.  These definitions
are in <b>ng-owl-map</b>.  Copy the contents of this file into the
<b>map</b>.

<p>

<!----------------------------------->

<a name="ig-manager-2.2.8."></a>
<h3>2.2.8. <b>htpasswd.users</b> (Apache)</h3>

<p>

Strictly speaking, this file is not a Nagios file, but is instead an
<b>httpd</b> file.  The Nagios configuration file for <b>httpd</b> gives the
name of an <b>htpasswd.users</b> file.  Use the <b>htpasswd</b> command to
create and populate this file with the users that should be allowed to access
the Owl monitor.  These users must have their permissions defined in the
Nagios <b>cgi.cfg</b> file.
