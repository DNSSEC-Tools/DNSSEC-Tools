This simple application (dnssec-test) simply creates a table full of
host names and then iteratively looks them all up to see if it can get
a valid answer and color codes the results into 2 tables.

Building
========

  # qmake-qt5            (or maybe just 'qmake' depending on your platform)
  # make

Running It
==========
  # ./dnssec-test

Internal Details
================

  If it can and the host shouldn't be accessible because of DNSSEC
  failures, it is marked as red.  If a domain name can be resolved and
  either it's a valid lookup or it's invalid and the lookup
  infrastructure correctly denied the results, it's flagged as green.

  There is also a "try tcp" button to ensure that if you attempt a TCP
  connection to the host's machine (on port 80) it'll fail as well.
