This .qml file can be run to show the loading of the DNSSEC-Deployment
website, which has an icon on the top of the page indicating if DNSSEC
is enabled or disabled.  With Qt patched to enable validation, the
logo should appear as a green check-box.

To run it:

  # qmlviewer test.qml

The advantage of this test is that it shows that the patch succeeds in
modifying many aspects of Qt, as the qml infrastructure is a layer
fairly high above the rest of the Qt code but even it gets protected
by the base patch.
