The patch included in the qt5.patch file modifies the base Qt code to:

  - make all DNS lookups (done using the Qt Classes) perform DNSSEC validation
    - This extends the returned error codes by 1, providing a new
      DNSNotTrusted enum returned by the QHostInfo class.
  - adds configure tests to add the needed libval and libsres
    libraries to the compilation line

Applying and Using The Patch
============================
  # cd QTSRCDIR/qtbase/
  # patch -p1 < /path/to/qt4.patch
  # cd ..
  # ./configure [with any options you want, such as "-prefix /opt/qt5-dnssec" ]
  # make
  # make install

  To create an application linked against the new qt-compiled
  libraries that were installed in a different directory, simply run
  qmake from that installation path:

  # cd dnssec-test
  # /opt/qt5-dnssec/bin/qmake
  # make
