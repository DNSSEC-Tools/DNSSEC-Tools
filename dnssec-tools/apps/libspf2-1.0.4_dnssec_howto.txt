			     (Version 0.1)

Introduction
------------

The DNSSEC extension to libspf2 provides DNSSEC validation to DNS queries in
libspf2.

This document describes how to install libspf2 with DNSSEC validation
functionality. A companion document, libspf2-1.0.4_dnssec_guide.txt, explains
how to use this DNSSEC validation functionality in applications that use
libspf2.

libspf2 can be downloaded from http://www.libspf2.org/download.html

To apply the libspf2-1.0.4_dnssec_patch, download libspf2-1.0.4.tar.gz from
the above website.

Unzip and untar it by:

	tar -xvzf libspf2-1.0.4.tar.gz

Go to the libspf2-1.0.4 directory:

	cd libspf2-1.0.4

Now apply the patch by:

	patch -p 0 -b -z .orig </path/to/patch/libspf2-1.0.4_dnssec_patch.txt

This will apply the patch and store the original files with a .orig suffix.

To compile, first run the following sequence of commands from the main
libspf2-1.0.4 directory to generate new 'configure' and other files needed
for compilation:

	aclocal
	autoheader
	libtoolize --automake --force
	automake
	autoconf

Then, configure, compile and install libspf2 as per the instructions given
in the libspf2-1.0.4 distribution.
