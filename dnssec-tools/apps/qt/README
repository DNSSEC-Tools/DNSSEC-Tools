The patch included in the qt4.patch file modifies the base Qt code to:

  - make all DNS lookups (done using the Qt Classes) perform DNSSEC validation
    - This extends the returned error codes by 1, providing a new
      DNSNotTrusted enum returned by the QHostInfo class.
  - adds configure tests to add the needed libval and libsres
    libraries to the compilation line
