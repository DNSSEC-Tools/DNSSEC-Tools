       http://dnssec-tools.sourceforge.net/

II.    Follow directions in 
       dnssec-tools/apps/libspf2-1.0.4_dnssec_howto.txt to install a
       patched version of libspf2-1.0.4 from:
       http://www.libspf2.org/

III.   Download postfix postfix-2.2.3.tar.gz from
       http://www.postfix.org.
       Download the spf2 patch, postfix-libspf2-2.2.0-5.patch, from Dean
       Strik at http://www.ipnet6.org/postfix/spf/.
