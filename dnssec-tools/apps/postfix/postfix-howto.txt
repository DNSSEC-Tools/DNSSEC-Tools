The following are the steps for patching the mail server postfix to
support libspf2.  If you are using a libspf2 library that has been
patched to support DNSSEC, this will allow that library to be used
by postfix.

NOTE: The version of the software that was tested is listed below.
      It is likely that the following steps will also work with
      slightly different versions.


I.     Install dnssec-tools.
       http://dnssec-tools.sourceforge.net/

II.    Use the patch and follow the directions in
       dnssec-tools/apps/libspf2/ to install a patched version of
       libspf2-1.2.5 from: 
       http://www.libspf2.org/

III.   Download postfix postfix-2.5.1.tar.gz from
       http://www.postfix.org and untar.

       Download the spf2 patch for postfix,
       postfix-2.3.2_libspf2-1.2.x-20060819.patch, 
       from Nigel Kukard at:
       http://www.linuxrulz.org/nkukard/postfix/postfix-2.3/postfix-2.3.2_libspf2-1.2.x-20060819.patch.

IV.    Untar and patch postfix:
         tar xvzf postfix-2.5.1.tar.gz
         cd postfix-2.5.1
         patch -p 1 < (path-to-spf-patch)/postfix-2.3.2_libspf2-1.2.x-20060819.patch

       NOTE: The patch command will produce warnings that some of
             the hunks are offset.  This is expected.

V.     Following the instructions that came with the patch.  After
       patching, these instructions are located in
       postfix-2.5.1/README_FILES/SPF_README.  Follow these
       directions to make and install postfix.
