This patch adds DANE support to curl.

Local validation of the TLSA record is enabled through dnsval (libval,
libsres) from the dnssec-tools package. The validation of the SSL/TLS
certificate against the certificate provided in the TLSA record is 
currently enabled only when openssl is used as the crypto engine.

After applying the patch execute the following commands before running 'make':
$ autoconf
$ autoheader

The DANE support can be tested as follows:
$ curl -v https://www.dnssec-tools.org/readme/README.curl
...
* DANE: TLSA record for www.dnssec-tools.org exists.
...
* DANE: SSL certificate verified using DANE.
* DANE: Skipping additional ceritificate checks.
...
