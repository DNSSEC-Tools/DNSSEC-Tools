		DNSSEC extension to libspf2-1.0.4: Developer Guide
		==================================================
			         (Version 0.1)

Introduction
------------

The DNSSEC extension to libspf2 provides DNSSEC validation to DNS
queries in libspf2.

This document describes the changes to libspf2 to provide the DNSSEC
validation.  It is intended as a guide to developers who want to use this
functionality offered by libspf2.


Additions to libspf2
--------------------

The SPF_get_spf function can now return an additional error value, if
DNSSEC validation fails:

    SPF_E_DNSSEC_FAILURE

The err_msg field in the output from the SPF_result() function in libspf2
now contains additional information about DNSSEC validation failure.  The
application can use this to inform the user of the application about dnssec
validation failure.
