This directory contains files for a thunderbird extension, called
'spfdnssec', that displays the Received-SPF mail header and its
various fields.  In particular, it displays the 'x-dnssec' field
that shows the result of DNSSEC validation during the SPF processing.

To compile, just run 'make'.  This will create a file named
spfdnssec.xpi.  This can be used to install the extension in
thunderbird from the Tools->Extensions menu.
