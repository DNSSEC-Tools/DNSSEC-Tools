This firefox extension contains an extension to show the internal
DNSSEC results of DNS lookups when visiting a web page.

Building:
========
sh ./build.sh

Installation
============

Open the Firefox Browser
Open File: 
    Select dnssecstatus.xpi 

Follow directions to complete the installation.

Operation
=========

When you visit web pages, you should see a new status bar section
describing the number of DNS lookups that failed validation. Additional
information can be obtained by clicking on the status bar information.

The best test of the operation can be found by making sure the
dnsval.conf file has a trust anchor configured for dnssec-tools.org
and the policy is set to validate.  Then go to www.dnssec-tools.org
and look at the bottom of the screen which will indicate how many DNS
lookups it took to view the page as well as the results of those lookups.


Original readme.txt from the Extension Wizard 
=============================================

This extension was generated by the Extension Wizard at
http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/extensionwiz/ .
This extension is compatible only with Firefox 1.5 and
above.  Most of the files in this package are based on
the 'helloworld' extension from the Mozillazine Knowledge Base.

You can build an XPI for installation by running the
build.sh script located in this folder.  For development
you should do the following:
  1. Unzip the entire contents of this package to somewhere,
           e.g, c:\dev or /home/user/dev
  2. Put the full path to the folder (e.g. c:\dev\dnssecstatus on
     Windows, /home/user/dev/dnssecstatus on Linux) in a file named
     dnsstatus@dnssectools.org and copy that file to
     [your profile folder]\extensions\
  3. Restart Firefox.
