Installation
============

Open the Firefox Browser
Open File: 
    Select dnssecstatus-0.1.xpi

Follow directions to complete the installation.

Operation
=========

When you visit web pages, you should see a new status bar section
describing the number of DNS lookups that were validated, trusted, or
in error.

The best test of the operation can be found by making sure the
dnsval.conf file has a trust anchor configured for dnssec-tools.org
and the policy is set to validate.  Then go to www.dnssec-tools.org
and look at the bottom of the screen which will indicate how many DNS
lookups it took to view the page as well as the results of those lookups.
