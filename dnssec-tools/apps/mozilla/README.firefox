			     DNSSEC-Tools
			Is your domain secure?

This directory contains a patch to apply to the mozilla code for
enabling DNSSEC checking of URL DNS names.  It is in beta form with a
lot of debugging but should be usable in testing environments.

The current patches are for Firefox 3.0.6, though they may work with
other 3.X releases.

# PREREQUISITES

  All of the following instructions assume you have the dnssec-tools
  package already install (specifically, libval and libsres).

######################################################################
# FIREFOX RPM
#

  The Fedora RPMs require patched xulrunner and nspr RPMS being
  installed first.  See README.nspr and README.xulrunner for
  instructions on rebuilding these RPMs for DNSSEC support.

  If you don't already have a rpm build tree, create one with
  rpmdeb-setuptree.  To build the firefox linux RPM on Fedora:

    cd ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS
    yumdownloader --source firefox
    rpm -ivh firefox-*

    cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/
    patch < ~/dnssec-tools/apps/mozilla/
    cd ~/dnssec-tools/apps/mozilla/
    cp dnssec-firefox.patch dnssec-both.patch dnssec-mozconfig.patch ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
    rpmbuild -bb ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/firefox.spec
    sudo rpm -Fvh ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/firefox-*

######################################################################
# FIREFOX FROM SOURCE
#

  The following summarizes what you need to do in order to build
  firefox from a source tree including the DNSSEC support.  It is
  probably best to follow an example from your distribution when
  creating a .mozconfig file.  The DNSSEC support should be
  automatically detected by configure and turned on if you have
  dnssec-tools installed.


  tar xjf firefox-3.0.6-source.tar.bz2
  cd mozilla
  patch -p1 < ../dnssec-firefox.patch
  patch -p1 < ../dnssec-both.patch

  # create a .mozconfig file; this is a stripped down version of what
  # gets put into the fedora RPMs but should work everywhere???:
  cat >> .mozconfig << EOF
. $topsrcdir/browser/config/mozconfig

ac_add_options --disable-tests
ac_add_options --disable-debug
ac_add_options --with-pthreads
ac_add_options --enable-default-toolkit=gtk2
ac_add_options --enable-pango
ac_add_options --enable-svg
ac_add_options --enable-canvas

EOF

  # finally build it all:
  make -f client.mk build
