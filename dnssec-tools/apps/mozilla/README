			     DNSSEC-Tools
			Is your domain secure?


This directory contains a patch to apply to the mozilla code for
enabling DNSSEC checking of URL DNS names.  It is in alpha/beta form
with a lot of debugging but should be usable in testing environments.

1) Install the dnssec-tools package first (we need a library)
2) Apply the patch found in this directory to the mozilla source tree
   (1.7.3ish).  The configure portion of the patch will probably fail,
   so run 'autoconf' (version 2.13 or so, not 2.5x) after you apply
   the patch.
3) Build mozilla adding in the --with-system-val flag to their
   configure script.  If you're using a ~/.mozconfig file then add
   this line to it:

     ac_add_options --with-system-val
