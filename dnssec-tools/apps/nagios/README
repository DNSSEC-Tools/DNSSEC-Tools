Nagios is an open-source system for monitoring networks and computers.
It has been enhanced to monitor zone rollover controlled by DNSSEC-Tools.
The modifications were made to Nagios Core version 3.2.3.

The DNSSEC-Tools additions to Nagios provide a monitoring service called
"Zone Rollover".  This service shows most zones in an okay -- green --
state.  If a zone is in need of administrative intervention, then the
zone's state is the warning -- yellow -- state.  

These additions work just like other additions to Nagios.  A plugin
retrieves the appropriate data and provides it to Nagios, which performs
the data display.  The required Nagios objects (hosts, commands, and
services) must be created, and the plugin put in the plugin directory.

An optional modification to a base Nagios file is provided as well.  This
modified file tunes a small amount of Nagios display data specifically for
DNSSEC-Tools monitoring.  The output is a little nicer, but monitoring is
not hindered if the option is not installed.


Caveat:  When using these modifications with Nagios, you must be aware
	 of the frequency of zone rollover actions and the frequency of
	 Nagios service checks.  It is almost certain that there will be
	 some amount of latency between actual zone rollover status and 
	 the rollover status displayed by Nagios.  This is the nature of
	 the system and it should be expected.  This is only a problem if
	 your zones are fast-rolling zones.  If a zone has a TTL of just
	 a few minutes, then the Nagios display will lag far behind reality.



Files
-----

This directory contains files for use in Nagios monitoring of zone rollover
controlled by DNSSEC-Tools.  Brief descriptions of these files are given
below.


	diff-status.c
		status.c is a standard part of the Nagios distribution,
		living in .../cgi/status.c.  It is a CGI that builds many
		of the Nagios status pages.  It has been modified to
		provide DNSSEC-Tools-specific results in the "Status"
		column of services output.  This is a diff of the original
		version and the version modified for DNSSEC-Tools.

		This modification is optional, but it provides
		nicer output for zone rollover monitoring.

		The file is located in the source hierarchy for Nagios.
		.../nagios-3.2.3/cgi/status.c

	dtnagobj
		This Perl script builds a file containing the Nagios
		objects required to display zone rollover status.  It
		is given the DNSSEC-Tools rollrec file used to manage a
		set of zones and it builds everything required to easily
		slide into a Nagios environment.

		The resulting objects file is *not* a stand-alone Nagios
		environment!  It must be added to a Nagios configuration.
		The objects file must be included by nagios.cfg, the main
		Nagios configuration file, in order for zone monitoring
		to occur.

		This should be run in the directory that contains the
		rollrec file.  Otherwise, the resulting object file will
		need to be executed in order to adjust the pathname for
		the rollrec file.

		"perldoc dtnagobj" will give additional information.

	dt_zonestat
		This Perl script is a Nagios plugin that determines
		the status of a zone.  It is referenced as part of the
		service objects created by dtnagobj.

		dt_zonestat must be installed in the standard Nagios
		plugin directory.

		"perldoc dt_zonestat" will give additional information.

	dt_donuts
		This Perl script is a Nagios plugin that determines
		if a zone file has any errors.  It executes the donuts
		command to determine if the zone file contains errors.
		It is referenced as part of the service objects created
		by dtnagobj.

		dt_donuts must be installed in the standard Nagios
		plugin directory.

		"perldoc dt_donuts" will give additional information.

	dt-trustman
		This Perl script is a Nagios plugin that checks for key
		verification of trust anchors.  It executes the trustman
		command to determine the verification.  It is intended
		to run as a remote plugin, though it can just as easily
		run on the Nagios host.

	sample.dnssec-tools.cfg
		This is a sample file containing the Nagios objects
		for monitoring three zones whose rollover is managed
		by DNSSEC-Tools.  The three zones are "test.com" and
		a split-view "example.com" having two views ("example.com"
		and "inside example".)

		This file was built by dtnagobj using sample.rollrec
		as its input.

	sample.rollrec
		This is a sample DNSSEC-Tools rollrec file, which was
		used as input to dtnagobj in order to create the
		sample-dnssec-tools.cfg file.  This file was taken from
		the Split-View Demo directory, which is part of the
		DNSSEC-Tools release.
