\subsection{Creating a Signed Delegation for a Child Zone}
\label{delegation-parent}

This section describes the steps a parent zone must take in order to create
a signed delegation for a child zone.

See Figures ~\ref{fig:zonesign-secure} and ~\ref{fig:securingdeleg-parent}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Ensure that the Child Keysets were Received Over a Secure Channel}

Secure communication between the parent and child zone is done out-of-band.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Ensure that Each Received Keyset is for a Delegated Zone}

The owner name for the DNSKEY record in the received keyset must correspond
to a valid delegation.
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in} 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \kill
\hspace{0.5in}\$ {\bf cat keyset-\underline{childzonefile}} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in} \underline{child.zone.name} \> \> 3600 IN \> \> DNSKEY 56 3 5 (\\
\hspace{0.5in} \> \> \> \> ... \\
\hspace{0.5in} \> \> \> \> ); key id = \underline{key-tag} \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ \\
\end{tabbing}

\underline{child.zone.name} must exist in the parent \underline{zonefile}
as a valid delegation.
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in} 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \kill
\hspace{0.5in}\$ {\bf cat \underline{zonefile}} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in} ... \\
\hspace{0.5in} \underline{child.zone.name} \> \> NS \> server \\
\hspace{0.5in} \> \> A \> ... \\
\hspace{0.5in} ... \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ \\
\end{tabbing}

\subsubsection{Store All Child Keysets in a Separate Directory}

This is simply to keep things clean.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Sign the Zone}

Sign the zone using steps described in Section~\ref{signzone-hasdel}.
