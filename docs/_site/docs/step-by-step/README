		DNSSEC-Tools Step-By-Step Operations Guide

This directory contains the LaTeX source and PostScript images for the
DNSSEC-Tools Step-By-Step Operations Guide.

To build the guide, execute the following command:

	$ make

This should process the source sufficiently such that all references
will be resolved.  This will create a PostScript file (sbs.ps) and a
device-independent DVI file (sbs.dvi).


Guide Organization
------------------

The LaTeX files are named in this manner:

	sbs.tex		main input file
	intro.tex	introductory section
	step-*.tex	each operational "step" (KSK roll-over, Signing a zone
			with no delegations, etc.) are kept in these files
	checklists.tex	the operation checklists, in an appendix

All other .tex files are included by multiple operational steps.  Changing
this for one step will change it for ALL other steps which include this file.
Be sure you really want this to happen before making the change.


Figure Modification
-------------------

The figures (figure-*.ps) are originally PowerPoint images that have been
saved as JPGs.  The JPGs are manually rotated 90 degrees so they fit on the 
page without becoming illegible through shrinking.

Follow these steps if you must modify an image:

	- modify the PPT file as needed
	- save the PPT file as a JPG
	- rotate the JPG file (using a program such as xv or pnmrotate)
	- save the rotated JPG as a PostScript file.

The PowerPoint files are stored in ./pictures/ppt.
The rotated JPGs are stored in ./pictures/jpg.
The PostScript files are stored in the main Step-By-Step document directory.
