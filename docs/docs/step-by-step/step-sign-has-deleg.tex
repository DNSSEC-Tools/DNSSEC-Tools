\subsection{Signing a Zone that Has Delegations}
\label{signzone-hasdel}

A zone needs to be re-signed when \underline{any} change is made to it.
Steps~\ref{keygen-set-hasdel} and~\ref{update-zonefile-hasdel} must be
followed if the zone has not been previously signed.
Steps~\ref{check-zonefile-unsigned-deleg}~-~\ref{signzone-deleg-last} must
be followed when re-signing a zone file that contains delegations.

See Figure~\ref{fig:zonesign-unsecure}.

\subsubsection{Sign the Zone}
\label{signzone-has-deleg}

Use the \cmd{dnssec-signzone} command to sign the zone file.
This should not be executed unless the keysets from all child zones have been
received.  (See Section~\ref{delegation-parent}.)

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\$ {\bf dnssec-signzone -g -k \underline{/path/to}/K\underline{zone.name}.+005+\underline{ksktag}.key} \\
\hspace{0.5in} {\bf -o \underline{zone.name} -e +2592000 -d \underline{keyset-dir} \underline{zonefile}} \\
\hspace{0.5in} {\bf \underline{/path/to}/K\underline{zone.name}.+005+\underline{zsktag-cur}.key} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in} \underline{zonefile}.signed \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ \\
\end{tabbing}

Signature generation may take a few minutes to complete, depending on the size
of the zone file. If the above operation appears to be unresponsive for an
unreasonable length of time, use pseudorandom numbers (using the \option{-p}
option) instead.

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\$ {\bf dnssec-signzone -g -k \underline{/path/to}/K\underline{zone.name}.+005+\underline{ksktag}.key} \\
\hspace{0.5in} {\bf -o \underline{zone.name} -p -e +2592000 -d \underline{keyset-dir} \underline{zonefile}} \\
\hspace{0.5in} {\bf \underline{/path/to}/K\underline{zone.name}.+005+\underline{zsktag-cur}.key} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in} \underline{zonefile}.signed \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ \\
\end{tabbing}

The \option{-d} option specifies the directory in which the child zone's
keyset files have been stored.  It there are no keyset files available, run
the \cmd{dnssec-signzone} command without the \option{-d keyset-dir} option.

Three files are created by \cmd{dnssec-signzone}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Signed zone file in \underline{zonefile}.signed.
The {\it .signed} suffix is appended by default.

\item Keyset file in keyset-\underline{zone.name}.
This may have to be sent to the parent zone if this zone is also a child zone;
see Section~\ref{delegation-child}.

\item DS-set file in dsset-\underline{zone.name}.
Used to verify that the correct DS record was generated at the parent;
see Section~\ref{delegation-child}.

\end{itemize}

The \cmd{dnssec-signzone} command generates signatures for the records that
are valid for 30 days (2,592,000 seconds) from the current time.  This
is offset by -1 hour to account for clock skew between the name server and
DNSSEC validators.

\subsubsection{Confirm DS Record Creation in Signed Zone File}

There should be a DS record in the signed zone file ({\it zone.name.signed})
for every domain name from which a keyset was received.
