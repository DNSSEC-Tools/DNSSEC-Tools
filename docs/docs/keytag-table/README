		DNSSEC-Tools Key-Tag Table

This directory contains the LaTeX source, PostScript image, device-independent
DVI image, and Excel spreadsheet for the DNSSEC-Tools Key-Tags table.  This
table is used to track the keys generated for a signed zone.

To build the PostScript and DVI images, execute the following command:

	$ make

This will create a PostScript file (keytag-table.ps) and a device-independent
DVI file (keytag-table.dvi).

The Excel spreadsheet containing a key-tags table is in keytag-table.xls.
