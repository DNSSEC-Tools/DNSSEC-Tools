local DNSSEC validation for ncftp
=================================

Introduction
------------

NcFTP contains support for performing local DNSSEC validation for
all DNS lookups. This document contains very brief instructions
on how to use this feature. Configuring DNS is out of the scope of this
document.


Background
----------

A detailed description of DNSSEC is out of scope for this document,
but a basic background is provided.

DNS response packets are fairly easy to spoof, so an attacker situated
in the network path between a client and its configured DNS server
could possibly inject DSN response packets, causing the client
to connect to another host.

DNSSEC introduces cryptographic signing of DNS records, allowing a
resolver to verify that a response has not been spoofed. This is
done by configuring 'Trust Anchors', which are known good keys used to
sign a zone.

Rationale for Local Validation
------------------------------

As DNSSEC deployment grows, more ISPs are offering DNS servers which
are DNSSEC aware and perform DNSSEC validation. So one might wonder
why they would want local validation. There are several reasons.

- Deployment of DNSSEC is progressing slowly, so end users might not
have DNS servers which are capable of, or configured for, DNSSEC processing.

- DNSSEC only guarantees the integrity of the DNS response to
the DNS server. The response from the DNS server to the local host
has no protection. Thus an attacker who can inject packets in the
path between a DNS server and a stub resolver can not only redirect
the client, but can make it belive a response was authentic!

- Even if a DNSSEC server is on a local and trusted network, an end
user might not have any influence over local policy. In other words,
they might not be able to get a new Trust Anchor configured for a
zone which they trust or mark a zone which is correctly signed as
untrusted.

- A DNSSEC server will not return data to an application for a response
which cannot be validated. The means that, to the client, the DNS lookups
will appear to have failed, even if the DNS server did get a response.
With local validation, the application can distinguish between a non-
responsive domain and validation failure.

Requirements
------------

This code requires that the DNSSEC-Tools resolver and validator
libraries and headers be installed. The DNSSEC-Tools package
can be obtained from:

	http://www.dnssec-tools.org/resources/download.html

Using DNSSEC validation
-----------------------

The extra validation code in NcFTP is optional, and must be enabled
by specifying --with-local-dnssec-validation when running configure.

This patch has been tested on ncftp-3.2.0, 3.2.1 and 3.2.3.

1) Apply the DNSSEC patch
2) run autoheader and autoconf to regenerate several important
   files. I had to use autoconf version 2.13.
3) Configure with: ./configure --with-dnssec-local-validation
4) make
5) sudo make install



Testing
-------
By default, DNSSEC-Tools' configuration file should be trying to validate
all zones. A few zones are signed, but most are not.

For domains which validate successfully, there is no difference in output:

For domains that do not validate successfully:

Viewing  Details
----------------
To see some debug output from the validation process, you can set the
VAL_LOG_TARGET environment variable. (Higher numbers will result in more
output. 5 is a good start, 7 is more than you really want.)
