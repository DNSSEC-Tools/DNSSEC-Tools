\section{About This Document}
\markboth{DNSSEC-Tools Software User Manual -- Manual Pages}{DNSSEC-Tools Software User Manual -- Manual Pages}
\label{sect-about}

The goal of the DNSSEC-Tools project is to create a set of tools, libraries,
patches, applications, wrappers, extensions, and plugins that will help ease
the deployment and maintenance of DNSSEC-related technologies. This document contains manual
pages for the commands, libraries, Perl modules, and data files that are part
of the DNSSEC-Tools distribution.  The document organization is described
below.

\begin{description}

\item
Section~\ref{sect-about} describes the DNSSEC-Tools Software User Manual.

\item
Section~\ref{sect-commands} describes the DNSSEC-Tools commands.  These
commands include programs to analyze and manipulate zone files, maintain the
DNSSEC-Tools environment, and to assist with zone signing and key rollover.
The commands are divided into functional groups:
DNSSEC-Tools maintenance commands (Section~\ref{ssect-cmds-maint}),
DNS zone file commands (Section~\ref{ssect-cmds-zone}),
zone-signing commands (Section~\ref{ssect-cmds-sign}), and
zone-rollover commands (Section~\ref{ssect-cmds-roll}).

\item
Section~\ref{sect-libraries} describes two libraries developed for
DNSSEC-Tools.  The \lib{libsres} library provides secure address resolution
for applications.  The \lib{libval} library provides DNSSEC Resource Record
validation.

\item
Section~\ref{sect-modules} describes a number of Perl modules that were
written to support the DNSSEC-Tools commands.  These modules may be used in
development of additional commands to work with the existing DNSSEC-Tools.

\item
Section~\ref{sect-files} describes data files used by the DNSSEC-Tools
commands, libraries, and modules.

\end{description}

and provided, please see one of the project web pages at:
