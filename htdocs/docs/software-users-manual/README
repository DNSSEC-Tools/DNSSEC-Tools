			DNSSEC-Tools Software User's Manual

Description:

	This directory contains the source for the DNSSEC-Tools Software
	User's Manual.  It may be built by running "make", which will
	create PostScript and DVI files.

Adding a New Man Page:

	If you are adding a new man page to the document, the source for the
	man page should be put in manpages.  A description and \input line
	should be added to one of the following:

		man-cmds.tex		commands
		man-files.tex		data file descriptions
		man-libs.tex		libraries
		man-modules.tex		Perl modules

	The podmantex command may be used to convert pod into a LaTeX manpage
	appropriate for the Software User's Manual.  This command does the
	majority of conversion necessary, but you still will probably have to
	tweak the file a bit.  See the conversion section below for hints.


Rebuilding Man Pages:

	If you're rebuilding all the pod man pages, your task will be greatly
	assisted by using the podtrans command.  Go to the appropriate
	directory and execute this command:

		$ podtrans -translator podmantex <tree> <outdir>

	<tree> is the name of the top-level hierarchy from which the pod
	search will start.

	<outdir> is the name of the output directory in which the converted
	pod will be stored.


Conversion Hints:
	Some tweaking of autogenerated .tex files will most likely be
	necessary.  The following things should be checked:

		- Check the contents of the \subsection at the top of the
		  file to ensure it's what you want.

		- For the purposes of the Software User's Manual, remove
		  the AUTHOR section from the man page.  This is only from
		  the LaTeX version, though, and not from the original pod.

		- Make the following replacements:

			original		new
			--------		---

			   _			\_
			   %			\%
			   >			$>$
			   <			$<$
			   [			$[$
			   ]			$]$
			   "    (left)		``
			   "	(right)		''

		  These replacements should only be made if the text
		  is not in a verbatim environment.

		- Convert tabs into the required number of spaces.

		- Any literal lines (lines beginning with whitespace) in the
		  pod will be put in a verbatim environment by podmantex.
		  Multiple consecutive such lines will take up a fair bit of
		  vertical space on the page.  Grouping all such consecutive
		  lines into a single verbatim environment will cut back on
		  the excess vertical space.

		  For example, the following literal lines:

			  test line 1
			  test line 2
			  test line 3

		  will be replaced with:

			\begin{verbatim}  test line 1\end{verbatim}
			\begin{verbatim}  test line 2\end{verbatim}
			\begin{verbatim}  test line 3\end{verbatim}

		  Vertical space will be saved if the above is manually
		  replaced with the following:

			\begin{verbatim}
			  test line 1
			  test line 2
			  test line 3
			\end{verbatim}
