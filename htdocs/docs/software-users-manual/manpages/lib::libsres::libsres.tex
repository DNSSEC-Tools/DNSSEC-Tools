{\bf DESCRIPTION}

The \func{<query\_send()} function sends a query to the name servers specified
in \var{nslist}.  The query is comprised of the \var{$<$name, class, type$>$}
tuple, and \var{trans\_id} provides a handle to this transaction within the
\lib{libsres} library.

The \func{response\_recv()} function returns the answers, if available, from
the name server that responds for the query identified by \var{trans\_id}.  The
response is available in \var{response} and the responding name server is
returned in \var{respondent}.  The length of the response in bytes is returned
in \var{response\_length}.

The \func{get()} function provides a wrapper around the \func{query\_send()}
and \func{response\_recv()} functions.  After sending a request, it blocks
until a response is received from some name server or until the request times
out.  The \lib{libsres} library does not automatically follow referrals;
responses containing referrals are treated as valid responses.

The memory pointed to by \var{*respondent} is internally allocated by the
\lib{libsres} library and must be freed by the invoker using
\func{free\_name\_server()}.  An entire list of name servers can be freed
using \func{free\_name\_servers()}.  A copy of the name server can be created
using \func{clone\_ns()} and a copy of a name server list can be made using
\func{clone\_ns\_list()}.

\func{print\_response()} provides a convenient way to display answers returned
in {\it response} by the name server.

\var{struct name\_server} is defined in \path{resolver.h} as follows.

\begin{verbatim}
    struct name_server
    {
        u_int8_t ns_name_n[NS_MAXCDNAME];
        void *ns_tsig;
        u_int32_t ns_security_options;
        u_int32_t ns_status;
        u_long  ns_options;
        int ns_retry;
        int ns_retrans;
        struct name_server *ns_next;
        int ns_number_of_addresses;
        struct sockaddr_storage **ns_address;
    };
\end{verbatim}


\begin{description}

\item \var{ns\_name\_n}\verb" "

The name of the zone for which this name server is authoritative.  

\item \var{ns\_tsig}\verb" "

The {\it tsig} key that should be used to protect messages sent to this name
server.  This field is currently unused and must be set to NULL.

\item \var{ns\_security\_options}\verb" "

The security options for the zone.  This field is currently unused and must be
set to \const{ZONE\_USE\_NOTHING}.

\item \var{ns\_status}\verb" "

The status of the zone.  This field indicates how the zone information was
obtained.  The invoker must set this value to \const{SR\_ZI\_STATUS\_UNSET}.
Zone information that was obtained through referrals have a value of
\const{SR\_ZI\_STATUS\_LEARNED} for this field.

\item \var{ns\_options}\verb" "

Specifies additional resolver flags. Currently defined flags are
\const{RES\_RECURSE}, which sets the ``Recursion Desired'' flag;
\const{RES\_USE\_DNSSEC}, which sets the ``DNSSEC OK'' bit in the EDNS0
header; and \const{RES\_DEBUG}, which enables debugging.

\item \var{ns\_retry}\verb" "

Specifies the maximum number of attempts that must be made to obtain a name
from an unresponsive name server before giving up.

\item \var{ns\_retrans}\verb" "

Specifies the retransmission interval in seconds for queries sent to
unresponsive name servers.

\item \var{ns\_next}\verb" "

The address of the next name server in the list.

\item \var{ns\_number\_of\_addresses}\verb" "

The number of elements in the array {\it ns\_addresses}.  This field is
currently unused.

\item \var{ns\_addresses}\verb" "

The IP address of the name server.

{\bf OTHER SYMBOLS EXPORTED}

The \lib{libsres} library also exports the following BIND functions,
documentation for which can be found in the BIND sources and documentation
manuals:
\begin{verbatim}
    res_nametoclass
    res_nametotype
    ns_name_ntop
    ns_name_pton
    ns_name_unpack
    ns_parse_ttl
    p_class
    p_section
    p_type
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}

\item \const{SR\_UNSET}\verb" "

No error.

\item \const{SR\_CALL\_ERROR}\verb" "

An invalid parameter was passed to \func{get()}, \func{query\_send()}, or
\func{response\_recv()}.

\item \const{SR\_INTERNAL\_ERROR}\verb" "

The resolver encountered some internal error.

\item \const{SR\_TSIG\_ERROR}\verb" "

The resolver encountered some TSIG-related error.  This is currently
not implemented.

\item \const{SR\_NO\_ANSWER}\verb" "

No answers were received from any name server.

\item \const{SR\_NO\_ANSWER\_YET}\verb" "

No answer currently available; the query is still active.

\item \const{SR\_WRONG\_ANSWER}\verb" "

The header bits did not correctly identify the message as a response.

\item \const{SR\_HEADER\_BADSIZE}\verb" "

The length and count of records in the header were incorrect.

\item \const{SR\_NXDOMAIN}\verb" "

The queried name did not exist.

\item \const{SR\_FORMERR}\verb" "

The name server was not able to parse the query message.

\item \const{SR\_SERVFAIL}\verb" "

The name server was not reachable.

\item \const{SR\_NOTIMPL}\verb" "

A particular functionality is not yet implemented.

\item \const{SR\_REFUSED}\verb" "

The name server refused to answer this query.

\item \const{SR\_DNS\_GENERIC\_FAILURE}\verb" "

Other failure returned by the name server and reflected in the
returned message B<RCODE>.

\item \const{SR\_EDNS\_VERSION\_ERROR}\verb" "

The EDNS version was not recognized

\item \const{SR\_NAME\_EXPANSION\_FAILURE}\verb" "

A failure was encountered while trying to expand a compressed domain name.

{\bf CURRENT STATUS}

There is currently no support for IPv6.

There is limited support for specifying resolver policy; members of the
{\it struct name\_server} are still subject to change.
