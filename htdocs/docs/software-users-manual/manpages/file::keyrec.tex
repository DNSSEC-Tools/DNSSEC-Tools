\subsection{{\it keyrec} Files}

{\bf NAME}

{\bf keyrec} - Zone and key data used by DNSSEC-Tools programs.

{\bf DESCRIPTION}

{\it keyrec} files contain data about zones signed by and keys generated by
the DNSSEC-Tools.  A {\it keyrec} file is organized in sets of {\it keyrec}
records.  Each {\it keyrec} must be either of {\it key} type or {\it zone}
type.  Key {\it keyrec}s describe how encryption keys were generated; zone
{\it keyrec}s describe how zones were signed.  A {\it keyrec} consists of a
set of keyword/value entries.

The DNSSEC-Tools {\bf keyrec} module manipulates the contents of a {\it
keyrec} file.  Module interfaces exist for looking up {\it keyrec} records,
creating new records, and modifying existing records.

The following is an example of a key {\it keyrec}:

\begin{verbatim}
    key        "Kexample.com.+005+39936"
            zonename        "example.com"
            keyrec_type     "ksk"
            algorithm       "rsasha1"
            random          "/dev/urandom"
            keypath         "./Kexample.com.+005+39936.key"
            ksklength       "1024"
            keyrec_gensecs  "1123771354"
            keyrec_gendate  "Thu Aug 11 14:42:34 2005"
\end{verbatim}

The following is an example of a zone {\it keyrec}:

\begin{verbatim}
    zone        "example.com"
            zsknew          "Kexample.com.+005+60521"
            zskpubpath      "./Kexample.com.+005+23057.key"
            zskcurpath      "./Kexample.com.+005+41702.key"
            kskpath         "./Kexample.com.+005+39936.key"
            zskpub          "Kexample.com.+005+23057"
            zskcur          "Kexample.com.+005+41702"
            kskpath         ""
            zskdirectory    "."
            signedfile      "db.example.com.signed"
            kskpath         ""
            kskkey          "Kexample.com.+005+39936"
            kskdirectory    "."
            endtime         "+604800"
            zonefile        "db.example.com"
            keyrec_type     "zone"
            keyrec_signsecs "1123771721"
            keyrec_signdate "Thu Aug 11 14:48:41 2005"
\end{verbatim}
