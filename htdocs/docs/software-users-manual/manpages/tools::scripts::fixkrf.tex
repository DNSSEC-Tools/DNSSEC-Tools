{\bf NAME}

fixkrf - Fixes DNSSEC-Tools {\it keyrec} files whose encryption key files
have been moved

{\bf SYNOPSIS}

\begin{verbatim}
  fixkrf [options] <keyrec-file> <dir 1> ... <dir N>
\end{verbatim}

{\bf DESCRIPTION}

This script checks a specified {\it keyrec} file to ensure that the referenced
encryption key files exist where listed.  If a key is not where the {\it keyrec}
specifies it should be, then {\it fixkrf} will search the given directories for
those keys and adjust the {\it keyrec} to match reality.  If a key of a
particular filename is found in multiple places, a warning will be printed
and the {\it keyrec} file will not be changed for that key.

{\bf OPTIONS}

\begin{description}

\item [-list]\verb" "

Display output about missing keys, but don't fix the {\it keyrec} file.

\item [-verbose]\verb" "

Display output about found keys as well as missing keys.

\item [-help]\verb" "

Display a usage message.
