{\bf NAME}

confchk - Check a DNSSEC-Tools configuration file for sanity.

{\bf SYNOPSIS}

\begin{verbatim}  confchk [options] config_file\end{verbatim}

{\bf DESCRIPTION}

{\it confchk} checks a DNSSEC-Tools configuration file to determine if the
entries are valid.

The {\it default\_keyrec} configuration entry is not checked.  This entry
specifies the default {\it keyrec} file name and isn't necessarily expected
to exist in any particular place.

The following checks are performed:

\begin{description}

\item [{\it algorithm}]\verb" "

Ensure the {\it algorithm} field is valid.  The acceptable values may be found
in the {\it dnssec-keygen} man page.

\item [{\it ksklength}]\verb" "

Ensure the {\it ksklength} field is valid.  The acceptable values may be found
in the {\it dnssec-keygen} man page.

\item [{\it zsklength}]\verb" "

Ensure the {\it zsklength} field is valid.  The acceptable values may be found
in the {\it dnssec-keygen} man page.

\item [{\it endtime}]\verb" "

Ensure the {\it endtime} field is valid.  This value is assumed to be in the
``+NNNNNN'' format.  There is a lower limit of two hours.  (This is an
artificial limit under which it may not make sense to have an endtime.)

\item [{\it random}]\verb" "

Ensure the {\it random} field is valid.  This file must be a character
device file.

\item [{\it checkzone}]\verb" "

Ensure the {\it checkzone} field is valid.  If the filename starts with a `/',
the file must be a regular executable file.

\item [{\it keygen}]\verb" "

Ensure the {\it keygen} field is valid.  If the filename starts with a `/',
the file must be a regular executable file.

\item [{\it signzone}]\verb" "

Ensure the {\it signzone} field is valid.  If the filename starts with a `/',
the file must be a regular executable file.

\end{description}

{\bf OPTIONS}

\begin{description}

\item [-quiet]\verb" "

No output will be given, but the number of errors will be used as the
exit code.

\item [-verbose]\verb" "

Verbose output will be given.

\item [-help]\verb" "

Display a usage message.
