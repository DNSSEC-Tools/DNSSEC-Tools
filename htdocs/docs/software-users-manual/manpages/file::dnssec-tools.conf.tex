{\bf NAME}

\path{dnssec-tools.conf} - Configuration file for the DNSSEC-Tools programs.

{\bf DESCRIPTION}

This file contains configuration information for the DNSSEC-Tools programs.
These configuration data are used if nothing else has been specified for a
particular program.  The \path{conf.pm} module is used to parse this
configuration file.

A line in the configuration file contains either a comment or a configuration
entry.  Comment lines start with either a `\#' character or a `;' character.
Comment lines and blank lines are ignored by the DNSSEC-Tools programs.

Configuration entries are in a {\it keyword/value} format.  The keyword is a
character string that contains no whitespace.  The value is a tokenized list
of the remaining character groups, with each token separated by a single space.

True/false flags must be given a {\bf 1} (true) or {\bf 0} (false) value.

{\bf Configuration Records}

The following records are recognized by the DNSSEC-Tools programs.
Not every DNSSEC-Tools program requires each of these records.

\begin{description}

\item [algorithm]\verb" "

The default encryption algorithm to be passed to \cmd{dnssec-keygen}.

\item [archivedir]\verb" "

The pathname to the archived-key directory.

\item [checkzone]\verb" "

The path to the \cmd{named-checkzone} command.

\item [default\_keyrec]\verb" "

The default {\it keyrec} filename to be used by the \perlmod{keyrec.pm} module.

\item [endtime]\verb" "

The zone default expiration time to be passed to \cmd{dnssec-signzone}.

\item [entropy\_msg]\verb" "

A true/false flag indicating if the \cmd{zonesigner} command should display
a message about entropy generation.  This is primarily dependent on the
implementation of a system's random number generation.

\item [keygen]\verb" "

The path to the \cmd{dnssec-keygen} command.

\item [ksklength]\verb" "

The default KSK key length to be passed to \cmd{dnssec-keygen}.

\item [ksklife]\verb" "

The default length of time between KSK roll-overs.  This is measured in
seconds.

This value is {\bf only} used for key roll-over.  Keys do not have a life-time
in any other sense.

\item [lifespan-max]\verb" "

The maximum length of time a key should be in use before it is rolled over.
This is measured in seconds.

\item [lifespan-min]\verb" "

The minimum length of time a key should be in use before it is rolled over.
This is measured in seconds.

\item [random]\verb" "

The random device generator to be passed to \cmd{dnssec-keygen}.

\item [savekeys]\verb" "

A true/false flag indicating if old keys should be moved to the
archive directory.

\item [signzone]\verb" "

The path to the \cmd{dnssec-signzone} command.

\item [usegui]\verb" "

Flag to allow/disallow usage of the GUI for specifying command options.

\item [zonesigner]\verb" "

The path to the \cmd{zonesigner} command.

\item [zskcount]\verb" "

The default number of ZSK keys that will be generated for each zone.

\item [zsklength]\verb" "

The default ZSK key length to be passed to \cmd{dnssec-keygen}.

\item [zsklife]\verb" "

The default length of time between ZSK roll-overs.  This is measured in
seconds.

This value is {\bf only} used for key roll-over.  Keys do not have a life-time
in any other sense.

\end{description}

{\bf Sample Times}

Several configuration fields measure various times.  This section is a
convenient reference for several common times, as measured in seconds.

\begin{verbatim}
    3600       - hour
    86400      - day
    604800     - week
    2592000    - 30-day month
    15768000   - half-year
    31536000   - year
\end{verbatim}
