    <title>Configuring and Serving a Signed Zone</title>

    <para>Several configuration files must be modified in order to serve a
    signed zone. Follow the steps below to configure your name server and have
    it start serving your signed zone.</para>

    <para><filename>named.conf</filename> is the name of the configuration
    file used in these examples. The configuration file may vary according to
    the needs of the administrator.</para>

    <section id="serve-add-zone">
        <title>Add the Signed Zone to the Name Server Configuration
        File</title>

        <para>The name of the signed zone file must be included in the name
        server's configuration file. If you are signing an existing zone, the
        current zone file in the configuration file must be replaced with the
        signed zone file. If you are signing a new zone, the new signed zone
        file must be added.</para>

        <para>For the zone whose name is <literal>zone-name</literal>, do the
        following:</para>

        <para><command># vi named.conf </command>
        <userinput>[ENTER]</userinput></para>

        <para><computeroutput>... zone "zone-name." { type master; file
        "zone-file.signed"; }; ...</computeroutput></para>

    <section id="serve-enable-dnssec">
        <title>Enable DNSSEC</title>

        <para>Add the <literal>dnssec-enable yes;</literal> option to the
        <filename>named.conf</filename> file.</para>

        <para><command># vi

    <section id="serve-check-configuration-file">
        <title>Check the Name Server Configuration File for Errors</title>

        <para>You must ensure that the configuration file modifications were
        performed correctly. The <command>named-checkconf</command> command
        will perform this verification. No output indicates that all is well
        with the zone.</para>
