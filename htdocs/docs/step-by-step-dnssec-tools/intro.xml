    <para>DNS Security (DNSSEC) helps protect against DNS-spoofing attacks by
    providing origin authentication and integrity protection of DNS
    information. Proper maintenance of a DNSSEC-enhanced DNS zone is essential
    to protecting the domain's zone data.</para>

    <para>This Step-by-Step DNSSEC-Tools Operator Guidance Document is
    intended for operations using the DNSSEC-Tools v1.0 distribution. It will
    assist operators in gaining operational experience with DNSSEC. Some basic
    understanding of DNSSEC terms and concepts is required. It follows the
    format laid out by <xref linkend="dnssec-operators-guide" />.</para>

    <para>This document is meant to be a learning aid and is not intended to
    define policy in any form. Any implicit recommendations for key sizes,
    signature validity periods, and command line parameters are for
    illustration purposes ONLY and MUST NOT be used in production environments
    unless due-diligence has been taken to ensure that these values are
    acceptable within such environments. See <xref
    linkend="dnssec-operational-practices" /> for suggestions on determining
    appropriate security characteristics.</para>

    <para>This document was written as part of the DNSSEC-Tools project. The
    goal of this project is to create a set of documentation, tools, patches,
    applications, libraries, wrappers, extensions, and plug-ins that will help
    ease the deployment of DNSSEC-related technologies. For more information
    about this project and the tools that are being developed and provided,
    please see the DNSSEC-Tools project web page at:

        <title>Key Concepts</title>

        <para>A number of concepts must be known in order to understand this
        document.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Zones and Authentication Keys</title>

            <para>Zones and Authentication Keys are essential for
            understanding this document, but they are also beyond its
            scope.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Zone Rollover</title>

            <para>As zone signatures expire, the zone must be re-signed with
            new keys. The process of generating new keys
            and re-signing the zone is called <emphasis>zone
            rollover</emphasis>. There are several rollover schemes (e.g.,
            Double-Signature Scheme and Pre-Publish Scheme) that are used for
            various purposes. These schemes are described in Sections ??? and
            ???.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Key-Tag Tables</title>

            <para>The Key-Tag Table is a record of zones, the zone's keys,
            attributes of the keys, and expiration dates. This may be kept in
            any usable form -- computer file, notebook, etc.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Keyrec Files</title>

            <para>Keyrec files function as Key-Tag Tables for DNSSEC-Tools
            utilities. They can be hand-edited, but the DNSSEC-Tools update
            them automatically.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Rollrec Files</title>

            <para>Rollrec files contain information needed by the DNSSEC-Tools
            key rollovers. They can be hand-edited, but the DNSSEC-Tools
            update them automatically.</para>

    <section id="intro-conventions">
        <title>Conventions Used in this Document</title>

        <para>One of the goals of this document is to self-contain DNS
        Security operations within sections and prevent constant
        cross-referencing between sections. Consequently, certain parts of the
        text are repeated throughout the document.</para>

        <para>Text marked in bold represents text or commands entered by users
        within a given procedural step.</para>

        <para>Underlined text, which can also be bold, is a place-holder for
        actual run-time values. These values are either automatically
        generated or are values that are known to the user from some other
        step.</para>

        <para>Additionally, the following typographical conventions are used
        in this document.</para>
