		Step-By-Step DNSSEC-Tools Operator Guidance Document

This directory contains the XML source for the Step-By-Step DNSSEC-Tools
Operator Guidance Document.

Build Requirements
------------------
DocBook XSL Stylesheets: <http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/>
libxslt: <http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/>
Apache FOP 0.20.5: <http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/>

1. Edit the Makefile and ensure that DOCBOOK_XSL points to
the location where the DocBook XSL Stylesheets are installed,
and that the paths to xsltproc and fop.sh are correct.

2. Edit the xsl/fo/sbs-dt.xsl file and ensure that the
<xsl:import href="" /> href location points to the location
where the DocBook XSL Stylesheets are installed.

3. Edit the xsl/html/sbs-dt.xsl file and ensure that the
<xsl:import href="" /> href location points to the location
where the DocBook XSL Stylesheets are installed.

To build the guide, execute the following command:

	$ make

This should process the source sufficiently such that all references
will be resolved.  

Guide Organization
------------------

The XML files are named in this manner:

	sbs-dt.xml	main input file
	intro.xml	introductory section
	step-*.xml	each operational "step" (KSK roll-over, Signing a zone
			with no delegations, etc.) are kept in these files

All other .xml files are included by multiple operational steps.  Changing
this for one step will change it for ALL other steps which include this file.
Be sure you really want this to happen before making the change.
