After Owl sensor data has been gathered for several hours and <b>rrdtool</b>
has been adding it to the RRD databases, you can consider how you will graph
the data.  Graphing capabilities are provided by <b>nagiosgraph</b> and
<b>drraw.cgi</b>.  Both are very useful and have their place in your Owl
monitor.  It isn't a question of which to use; the question is how you want
to use each and how you want to display your monitoring data.

<h3>5.1. Graphing with <b>nagiosgraph</b></h3>

<b>nagiosgraph</b> provides menus for easy selection of data, available
through three CGI scripts.  These are simple graphs that only display a
single sensor/root server/DNS record per graph.  For these scripts, the
host is an Owl sensor and the service is a root server/DNS record type.
Links for these scripts are included in the <b>example-side.php</b> file.

<ul>
<li><b>show.cgi</b> - Provides graphs for a user-selected host/service pair.
A graph is provided for the current day, week, month, and year.
<p>

<li><b>showhost.cgi</b> - Provides graphs for a user-selected host.
A graph will be displayed for any service with that host.
A graph is provided for the current day, week, and month.
<p>

<li><b>showservice.cgi</b> - Provides graphs for a user-selected service.
A graph will be displayed for any host with that service.
A graph is provided for the current day, week, and month.
<p>

</ul>

<h3>5.2. Graphing with <b>drraw.cgi</b></h3>

<p>

<b>drraw.cgi</b> provides a much more complex graphing capability than is
available through <b>nagiosgraph</b>.  It allows data from multiple
sensor/root server/DNS record groups to be displayed on a single graph.
Set-up for the graphs is not difficult and is done through a browser-based
interface.  However,  there are a number of things that must be specified
before the graph can be displayed.

<p>

The graph-definition webpage talks about selecting data sources to be
displayed.  This is referring to the group of RRD databases you want
<b>drraw.cgi</b> to use for this particular graph.

<p>

Defining simple graphs, even those with multiple data sources, is not
complicated.  However, you can define fairly involved graphs (e.g.,
averaging data from different databases) with <b>drraw.cgi</b>.

<p>

<h3>5.3. Adding Graphs to the Nagios Sidebar</h3>

The <b>share/side.php</b> script builds the left sidebar of links on
the Nagios page.  Several simple modifications will improve access to
the graphing facilities.  Obviously, this step must wait until after
the system has been set up and site-specific graphs have been defined.

<p>

The <b>example-side.php</b> file (in the Owl manager distribution) contains
sample lines for both <b>drraw.cgi</b> and <b>nagiosgraph</b>.  Add the
contents of this file to the <b>share/side.php</b> file after the "Quick
Search" text-entry box.

<p>

The sample lines must be modified for your installation in the following ways:

<ul>
<li>The paths in the links must match the way you installed it.

<p>

<li>If links to specific <b>drraw.cgi</b> graphs are to be included in the
sidebar, then the graph id in the link must be set.  The id for a particular
graph may be found from the graph's URL, and is the field following "Graph=".

<p>

</ul>
