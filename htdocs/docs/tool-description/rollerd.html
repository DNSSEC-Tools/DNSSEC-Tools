<p>rollerd - DNSSEC-Tools daemon to manage DNSSEC key rollover</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<pre>
  rollerd [-options] -rrfile &lt;rollrec_file&gt;</pre>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>rollerd</strong> daemon manages key rollover for zones.  <strong>rollerd</strong> handles
both KSK and ZSK rollover, though only one rollover may take place at a time.
Initiation of KSK rollovers takes precedence over the initiation of ZSK
rollovers.  The Pre-Publish Method of key rollover is used for ZSK key
rollovers.  The Double Signature Method of key rollover is used for KSK
rollovers.  <strong>rollerd</strong> maintains zone rollover state in files called
<em>rollrec</em> files.  The administrator may control <strong>rollerd</strong> with the
<strong>rollctl</strong> command.  These are described in their own sections below.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="zsk_rollover_using_the_pre_publish_method">ZSK Rollover Using the Pre-Publish Method</a></h2>
<p>The Pre-Publish Method has four phases that are entered when it is time to
perform ZSK rollover:</p>
<pre>
    1. wait for old zone data to expire from caches
    2. sign the zone with the KSK and Published ZSK
    3. wait for old zone data to expire from caches
    4. adjust keys in keyrec and sign the zone with new Current ZSK</pre>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> uses the <strong>zonesigner</strong> command during ZSK rollover phases 2 and 4.
<strong>zonesigner</strong> will generate keys as required and sign the zone during these
two phases.</p>
<p>The Pre-Publish Method of key rollover is defined in the Step-by-Step DNS
Security Operator Guidance Document.  See that document for more detailed
information.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="ksk_rollover_using_the_double_signature_method">KSK Rollover Using the Double Signature Method</a></h2>
<p>The Double Signature Method has seven phases that are entered when it is time
to perform KSK rollover:</p>
<pre>
    1. wait for old zone data to expire from caches
    2. generate a new (published) KSK
    3. wait for the old DNSKEY RRset to expire from caches
    4. roll the KSKs
    5. transfer new keyset to the parent
    6. wait for parent to publish the new DS record
    7. reload the zone</pre>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> uses the <strong>zonesigner</strong> command during KSK rollover phases 2 and 4.
<strong>zonesigner</strong> will generate keys as required and sign the zone during these
two phases.</p>
<p>Currently, step 6 is handled manually.  In step 5, <strong>rollerd</strong> informs the
administrator via email that the zone's keyset must be transferred to its
parent in order for rollover to continue.  In step 6, after the keyset has
been transferred to the parent and the parent has published a new DS record,
the administrator uses <strong>rollctl</strong> to inform <strong>rollerd</strong> that the DS record has
been published and rollover may continue.</p>
<p>The Double Signature Method of key rollover is defined in the Step-by-Step
DNS Security Operator Guidance Document.  See that document for more detailed
information.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="ksk_rollover_using_the_double_signature_method_and_rfc5011">KSK Rollover Using the Double Signature Method and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5011.txt" class="rfc">RFC5011</a></a></h2>
<p>RFC5011 describes how remote-validating resolvers must track KSK changes
within a zone.  If configured for <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5011.txt" class="rfc">RFC5011</a> behavior, <strong>rollerd</strong> and
<strong>zonesigner</strong> add an extra-long period of time between the point a new KSK is
created and published and the point where the actual switch to using it takes
place.  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5011.txt" class="rfc">RFC5011</a> specifies that remote validators should add a &quot;hold-down
timer&quot; to the rollover process, such that the new key is not added as a
trust-anchor until 30 days have past.  Thus, <strong>rollerd</strong> will wait for 60 days
(by default) during phase 3 of the KSK rollover process if the &quot;istrustanchor&quot;
field of the <em>rollrec</em> definition has been set to either 1 or &quot;yes&quot;.  To wait
for a different length of time other than 60 days, use the <strong>holddowntime</strong>
field.</p>
<p>At this time, the other conventions of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5011.txt" class="rfc">RFC5011</a> are not being followed.
Specifically, it's not waiting for a while before removing the old key
and it's not adding the revoke bit to the old key after switching.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="zone_reloading">Zone Reloading</a></h2>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> has the opportunity to inform the DNS daemon to reload a zone in
KSK phase 2, KSK phase 7, ZSK phase 2, and ZSK phase 4.  This is the
<strong>rollerd</strong>'s default behavior.  However, there are situations where this
shouldn't be done, such as for off-line signing.</p>
<p>The <strong>roll_loadzone</strong> field of the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file is a boolean
field that overrides the default to force the zone-reload behavior either on
or off.  This field takes precedence over the default.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <strong>-noreload</strong> option prevents <strong>rollerd</strong> from requesting a zone
reload, and it takes precedence over the <strong>roll_loadzone</strong> configuration field
and the default.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="rollrec_files"><em>rollrec</em> Files</a></h2>
<p>The zones to be managed by <strong>rollerd</strong> are described in a <em>rollrec</em>
file.  Generally speaking most people will want to use the <strong>rollinit</strong>
command to create an initial <em>rollrec</em> file instead of typing their
own from scratch.  See the INITIALIZATION AND USAGE section below and
the <strong>rollinit</strong> manual page for details. Each zone's entry contains
data needed by <strong>rollerd</strong> and some data useful to a user.  Below is a
sample <em>rollrec</em> entry:</p>
<pre>
        roll &quot;example.com&quot;
                zonename        &quot;example.com&quot;
                zonefile        &quot;example.com.signed&quot;
                keyrec          &quot;example.com.krf&quot;
                directory       &quot;dir-example.com&quot;
                kskphase        &quot;0&quot;
                zskphase        &quot;3&quot;
                ksk_rollsecs    &quot;1172614842&quot;
                ksk_rolldate    &quot;Tue Feb 27 22:20:42 2007&quot;
                zsk_rollsecs    &quot;1172615087&quot;
                zsk_rolldate    &quot;Tue Feb 27 22:24:47 2007&quot;
                maxttl          &quot;60&quot;
                display         &quot;1&quot;
                phasestart      &quot;Tue Feb 27 22:25:07 2007&quot;
                # optional records for RFC5011 rolling:
                istrustanchor   &quot;no&quot;
                holddowntime    &quot;60D&quot;</pre>
<p>The first line gives the <em>rollrec</em> entry's name.  The name distinguishes it
from other <em>rollrec</em> entries and must be unique.  This may be the zone's
name, but this is not a requirement.  The following lines give the zone's
name, the zone's signed zone file, <em>keyrec</em> file, the current rollover
phases, the rollover timestamps, and other information.</p>
<p>If either of the <em>zonefile</em> or <em>keyrec</em> files do not exist, then a &quot;roll&quot;
<em>rollrec</em> will be changed into a &quot;skip&quot; <em>rollrec</em>.  That record will not be
processed.</p>
<p>A more detailed explanation may be found in <em>rollrec(5)</em>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="directories">Directories</a></h2>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong>'s execution directory is either the directory in which it is
executed or the directory passed in the <strong>-directory</strong> command-line option.
Any files used by <strong>rollerd</strong> that were not specified with absolute paths use
this directory as their base.</p>
<p>A <em>rollrec</em> file's <em>directory</em> field informs <strong>rollerd</strong> where the zone's
files may be found.  For that zone, <strong>rollerd</strong> will move into that directory,
then return to its execution directory when it finishes rollover operations
for that zone.  If the <em>directory</em> value is a relative path, it will be
appended to <strong>rollerd</strong>'s execution directory.  If the <em>directory</em> value is an
absolute path, it will be used as is.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="controlling_rollerd_with_rollctl">Controlling <strong>rollerd</strong> with <strong>rollctl</strong></a></h2>
<p>The <strong>rollctl</strong> command is used to control the behavior of <strong>rollerd</strong>.  A
number of commands are available, such as starting or stopping rollover for a
selected zone or all zones, turning on or off a GUI rollover display, and
halting <strong>rollerd</strong> execution.  The communications path between <strong>rollerd</strong> and
<strong>rollctl</strong> is operating system-dependent.  On Unix-like systems, it is a Unix
pipe that should <strong>only</strong> be writable by the user which runs <em>rollerd</em>.  A
more detailed explanation of <strong>rollctl</strong> may be found in <em>rollctl(8)</em>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="a_note_about_files_and_filenames">A Note About Files and Filenames</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of files and filenames used by <strong>rollerd</strong> and
<strong>zonesigner</strong>.  The user must be aware of the files used by these programs,
where the files are located, and where the programs are executed.</p>
<p>By default, <strong>rollerd</strong> will change directory to the DNSSEC-Tools directory,
though this may be changed by the <strong>-directory</strong> option.  Any programs started
by <strong>rollerd</strong>, most importantly <strong>zonesigner</strong>, will run in this same
directory.  If files and directories referenced by these programs are named
with relative paths, those paths must be relative to this directory.</p>
<p>The <em>rollrec</em> entry name is used as a key to the <em>rollrec</em> file and to the
zone's <em>keyrec</em> file.  This entry does not have to be the name of the
entry's domain, but it is a very good idea to make it so.  Whatever is used
for this entry name, the same name <strong>must</strong> be used for the zone <em>keyrec</em> in
that zone's <em>keyrec</em> file.</p>
<p>It is probably easiest to store <em>rollrec</em> files, <em>keyrec</em> files, zone
files, and key files in a single directory.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="initialization_and_usage">INITIALIZATION AND USAGE</a></h1>
<p>The following steps must be taken to initialize and use <strong>rollerd</strong>.  This
assumes that zone files have been created, and that BIND and DNSSEC-Tools
have been installed.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="sign_zones" class="item">sign zones</a></strong>

<p>The zones to be managed by <strong>rollerd</strong> must be signed.  Use <strong>zonesigner</strong> to
create the signed zone files and the <em>keyrec</em> files needed by <strong>rollerd</strong>.
The <em>rollrec</em> file created in the next step <strong>must</strong> use the <em>keyrec</em> file
names and the signed zone file names created here.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="create_rollrec_file" class="item">create <em>rollrec</em> file</a></strong>

<p>Before <strong>rollerd</strong> may be used, a <em>rollrec</em> file must first be created.
While this file may be built by hand, the <strong>rollinit</strong> command was
written specifically to build the file.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="select_operational_parameters" class="item">select operational parameters</a></strong>

<p>A number of <strong>rollerd</strong>'s operational parameters are taken from the
DNSSEC-Tools configuration file.  However, these may be overridden
by command-line options.  See the OPTIONS section below for more details.
If non-standard parameters are desired to always be used, the appropriate
fields in the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file may be modified to use these
values.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="install_the_rollover_configuration" class="item">install the rollover configuration</a></strong>

<p>The complete rollover configuration -- <strong>rollerd</strong>, <em>rollrec</em> file,
DNSSEC-Tools configuration file values, zone files -- should be installed.  
The appropriate places for these locations are both installation-dependent
and operating system-dependent.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="test_the_rollover_configuration" class="item">test the rollover configuration</a></strong>

<p>The complete rollover configuration should be tested.</p>
<p>Edit the zone files so that their zones have short TTL values.  A minute TTL
should be sufficient.  Test rollovers of this speed should <strong>only</strong> be done
in a test environment without the real signed zone.</p>
<p>Run the following command:</p>
<pre>
    rollerd -rrfile test.rollrec -logfile - -loglevel info -sleep 60</pre>
<p>This command assumes the test <em>rollrec</em> file is <strong>test.rollrec</strong>.  It writes
a fair amount of log messages to the terminal, and checks its queue every 60
seconds.  Follow the messages to ensure that the appropriate actions, as
required by the Pre-Publish Method, are taking place.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="set_rollerd_to_start_at_boot" class="item">set <strong>rollerd</strong> to start at boot</a></strong>

<p>Once the configuration is found to work, <strong>rollerd</strong> should be set to start
at system boot.  The actual operations required for this step are operating
system-dependent.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="reboot_and_verify" class="item">reboot and verify</a></strong>

<p>The system should be rebooted and the <strong>rollerd</strong> logfile checked to ensure
that <strong>rollerd</strong> is operating properly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="options">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p>There are a number of operational parameters that define how <strong>rollerd</strong> works.
These parameters define things such as the <em>rollrec</em> file, the logging level,
and the log file.  These parameters can be set in the DNSSEC-Tools
configuration file or given as options on the <strong>rollerd</strong> command line.
The command line options override values in the configuration file.</p>
<p>The following options are recognized:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="alwayssign" class="item"><strong>-alwayssign</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Tells <strong>rollerd</strong> to sign the zones that aren't in the middle of being
rolled.  This allows <strong>rollerd</strong> to refresh signed zone signatures and
allows complete management of zone signing to be taken over by <strong>rollerd</strong>.</p>
<p>The downside to using this option is that all the non-rolling zones will be
signed after every sleep, which may be expensive computationally.</p>
<p>Note:  The zone files are not updated or installed at this time.
Manual copying and installation is still needed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="directory_dir" class="item"><strong>-directory dir</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sets the <strong>rollerd</strong> execution directory.  This must be a valid directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="display" class="item"><strong>-display</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Starts the <strong>blinkenlights</strong> graphical display program to show the status of
zones managed by <strong>rollerd</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="dtconfig_config_file" class="item"><strong>-dtconfig config_file</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Name of an alternate DNSSEC-Tools configuration file to be processed.
If specified, this configuration file is used <em>in place</em> of the normal
DNSSEC-Tools configuration file <strong>not</strong> in addition to it.  Also, it will be
handled prior to <em>keyrec</em> files, <em>rollrec</em> files, and command-line options.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="foreground" class="item"><strong>-foreground</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Run in the foreground and do not fork into a daemon.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="logfile_log_file" class="item"><strong>-logfile log_file</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sets the <strong>rollerd</strong> log file to <em>log_file</em>.
This must be a valid logging file, meaning that if <em>log_file</em> already
exists, it must be a regular file.  The only exceptions to this are if
<em>logfile</em> is <strong>/dev/stdout</strong>, <strong>/dev/tty</strong>, <strong>-</strong>.  Of these three, using a
<em>log_file</em> of <strong>-</strong> is preferable since Perl will properly convert the <strong>-</strong>
to the process' standard output.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="loglevel_level" class="item"><strong>-loglevel level</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sets <strong>rollerd</strong>'s logging level to <em>level</em>.  <strong>rollmgr.pm(3)</strong> contains a list
of the valid logging levels.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="noreload" class="item"><strong>-noreload</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Prevents <strong>rollerd</strong> from telling the DNS daemon to reload zones.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="parameters" class="item"><strong>-parameters</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Prints a set of <strong>rollerd</strong> parameters and then exits.  This shows the
parameters with which <strong>rollerd</strong> will execute, but very little parameter
validation is performed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="pidfile_pid_file" class="item"><strong>-pidfile pid_file</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Stores the running process PID into <em>pid_file</em>.  This defaults to
<strong>/var/run/rollerd.pid</strong> on most systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="rrfile_rollrec_file" class="item"><strong>-rrfile rollrec_file</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Name of the <em>rollrec</em> file to be processed.  This is the only required
&quot;option&quot;.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="singlerun" class="item"><strong>-singlerun</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Processes all needed steps once and exits.  This is not the ideal way to run
<strong>rollerd</strong>, but it is potentially useful for environments where keying
material is only available when specific hardware tokens have been made
available.</p>
<p>The timing between the steps will be potentially longer since the
time between <strong>rollerd</strong> runs is dependent on when <strong>rollerd</strong> is executed.
&quot;cmd&quot; lines must be added to the <em>rollrec</em> file to do particular actions.</p>
<p>The following lines should serve as examples:</p>
<pre>
  cmd &quot;rollzsk example.com&quot;
  cmd &quot;rollksk example.com&quot;
  cmd &quot;dspub example.com&quot;   # (for when the parent publishes
                            # the new ksk)</pre>
<p>The <em>-singlerun</em> option implicitly implies <em>-foreground</em> as well.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="sleep_sleeptime" class="item"><strong>-sleep sleeptime</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sets <strong>rollerd</strong>'s sleep time to <em>sleeptime</em>.  The sleep time is the amount
of time (in seconds) <strong>rollerd</strong> waits between processing its <em>rollrec</em>-based
queue.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="username_username" class="item"><strong>-username username</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p><strong>username</strong> is the user for which the <strong>rollerd</strong> daemon will be executed.
The <strong>rollerd</strong> process' effective uid will be set to the uid corresponding
to <strong>username</strong>.</p>
<p>If <strong>username</strong> is a username, it must correspond to a valid uid; if it is
a uid, it must correspond to a valid username.</p>
<p>If <strong>rollerd</strong> does not have the appropriate O/S magic (e.g., for Unix,
installed as <em>setuid</em> program and owned by root) then it will only be able
to switch to those users to which the executing user has privilege to switch.
This restriction is dependent on the operating system and the manner by which
<strong>rollerd</strong> is installed.</p>
<p>When using this option, the target user must have access to the various
directories, logs, and data files that <strong>rollerd</strong> requires to execute.
Without this access, proper execution cannot occur.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="version" class="item"><strong>-Version</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Displays the version information for <strong>rollerd</strong> and the DNSSEC-Tools package.</p>
</dd>

<h1><a name="assumptions">ASSUMPTIONS</a></h1>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> uses the <strong>rndc</strong> command to communicate with the BIND
