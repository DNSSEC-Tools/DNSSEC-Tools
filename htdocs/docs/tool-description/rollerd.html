<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>rollerd</strong> daemon manages key rollover for zones.  <strong>rollerd</strong> is just a
scheduler for zone rollover; it uses <strong>zonesigner</strong> to perform the actual key
generation, zone signing, and key manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> manages both KSK and ZSK rollover, though only one rollover type
per zone may take place at a time.  Initiation of KSK rollovers takes
precedence over the initiation of ZSK rollovers.</p>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> uses two methods of key rollover.  The Pre-Publish Method of key
rollover is used for ZSK key rollovers.  The Double Signature Method of key
rollover is used for KSK rollovers.  These methods are described more fully
below.</p>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> maintains zone rollover state in files called <em>rollrec</em> files;
zone/key mappings are stored in <em>keyrec</em> files.  <strong>rollerd</strong> only modifies
<em>rollrec</em> files.  For the most part, <strong>rollerd</strong> does not modify <em>keyrec</em>
directly, but relies on <strong>zonesigner</strong> to update those files as needed.
(The exceptions where <strong>rollerd</strong> modifies <em>keyrec</em> files.  At start-up,
it will mark each managed zone's <em>keyrec</em> file to indicate the zone is under
<strong>rollerd</strong>'s control.  During the course of rollover, <strong>rollerd</strong> will also
update a zone's rollover times in its <em>keyrec</em> file.)</p>
<p>The administrator may control <strong>rollerd</strong> with the <strong>rollctl</strong> command.  A large
number of commands are available to control and modify <strong>rollerd</strong>'s operation,
as well as to retrieve information about rollover and daemon status.</p>
<p>The zone administrator will need to update their zone files periodically.  If
<strong>rollerd</strong> is managing zones, then problems could arise if modified zones were
signed without <strong>rollerd</strong>'s knowledge.  To prevent such problems, <strong>rollerd</strong>
can be configured to automatically re-sign a zone when its zonefile is found
to be newer than its corresponding signed zonefile.  (The files' &quot;last
modification&quot; timestamps are compared.)  The zone will be re-signed without
any other rollover actions taking place, so no new keys will be generated, no
key rollovers will occur, and the various rollover timers will be unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> will perform these re-signs by default, but this can be further
controlled by the <em>autosign</em> configuration parameter and <strong>rollerd</strong>'s
<strong>-autosign</strong>/<strong>-noautosign</strong> command line options.  If <strong>rollerd</strong> is configured
to not perform automatic re-signing, the administrator can still get this
controlled behavior by use of the <strong>zonesigner</strong> or <strong>rollctl</strong> commands.</p>
<p>If the <strong>rollrec</strong> file does not exist or is of zero length, <strong>rollerd</strong> will
give an error message and continue running.  It will periodically wake up and
check for a usable <strong>rollrec</strong> file.  Once it finds the specified <strong>rollrec</strong>
file exists and isn't empty, then it will proceed with normal rollover
management.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="zsk_rollover_using_the_pre_publish_method">ZSK Rollover Using the Pre-Publish Method</a></h2>
<p>The Pre-Publish Method has four phases that are entered when it is time to
perform ZSK rollover:</p>
<pre>
    1. wait for old zone data to expire from caches
    2. sign the zone with the KSK and Published ZSK
    3. wait for old zone data to expire from caches
    4. adjust keys in keyrec and sign the zone with new Current ZSK</pre>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> uses the <strong>zonesigner</strong> command during ZSK rollover phases 2 and 4.
<strong>zonesigner</strong> will generate keys as required and sign the zone during these
two phases.</p>
<p>The Pre-Publish Method of key rollover is defined in the Step-by-Step DNS
Security Operator Guidance Document.  See that document for more detailed
information.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="ksk_rollover_using_the_double_signature_method">KSK Rollover Using the Double Signature Method</a></h2>
<p>The Double Signature Method has seven phases that are entered when it is time
to perform KSK rollover:</p>
<pre>
    1 - wait for cache data to expire
    2 - generate a new (published) KSK and load zone
    3 - wait for the old DNSKEY RRset to expire from caches
    4 - transfer new keyset to the parent
    5 - wait for parent to publish DS record
    6 - wait for cache data to expire
    7 - roll the KSKs and load the zone</pre>
<p>This is a modification of the original Double Signature Method.  In the
original method, the KSK keys were rolled before the new keyset was
transferred to the parent.  The new method rolls the KSK keys after the
parent has published the new DS records and old data has expired for caches.
This addresses a potential problem with signing zones during key rollovers.</p>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> uses the <strong>zonesigner</strong> command during KSK rollover phases 2 and 7.
<strong>zonesigner</strong> will generate keys as required and sign the zone during these
two phases.</p>
<p>Currently, leaving the waiting period in step 5 is handled manually.  In step
4, <strong>rollerd</strong> informs the administrator via email that the zone's keyset must
be transferred to its parent in order for rollover to continue.  In step 5,
after the keyset has been transferred to the parent and the parent has
published a new DS record, the administrator uses <strong>rollctl</strong> to inform
<strong>rollerd</strong> that the DS record has been published and rollover may continue.</p>
<p>The Double Signature Method of key rollover is defined in the Step-by-Step
DNS Security Operator Guidance Document.  See that document for more detailed
information.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="ksk_rollover_using_the_double_signature_method_and_rfc5011">KSK Rollover Using the Double Signature Method and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5011.txt" class="rfc">RFC5011</a></a></h2>
<p>RFC5011 describes how remote-validating resolvers must track KSK changes
within a zone.  If configured for <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5011.txt" class="rfc">RFC5011</a> behavior, <strong>rollerd</strong> and
<strong>zonesigner</strong> add an extra-long period of time between the point a new KSK is
created and published and the point where the actual switch to using it takes
place.  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5011.txt" class="rfc">RFC5011</a> specifies that remote validators should add a &quot;hold-down
timer&quot; to the rollover process, such that the new key is not added as a
trust-anchor until 30 days have past.  Thus, <strong>rollerd</strong> will wait for 60 days
(by default) during phase 3 of the KSK rollover process if the &quot;istrustanchor&quot;
field of the <em>rollrec</em> definition has been set to either 1 or &quot;yes&quot;.  To wait
for a different length of time other than 60 days, use the <strong>holddowntime</strong>
field.</p>
<p>At this time, the other conventions of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5011.txt" class="rfc">RFC5011</a> are not being followed.
Specifically, it's not waiting for a while before removing the old key
and it's not adding the revoke bit to the old key after switching.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="site_specific_rollover_actions">Site-Specific Rollover Actions</a></h2>
<p>An administrator can specify site-specific commands to be run during the
various rollover phases.  The commands can be run in place of the default
<strong>rollerd</strong> rollover actions, or in addition to them.  This subsection
describes how to make use of site-specific rollover actions.</p>
<p>This capability is provided to allow different installations to handle
rollover according to their specific needs.  For example, it is anticipated
that this might be helpful to sites using HSM hardware, or to allow for
enhanced reporting to administrators.  This has been used with simple test
programs to ensure that it actually works.  However, it has not yet been used
in actual HSM environment or with other production-level software
replacements.</p>
<p>See the <em>ZSK Rollover Using the Pre-Publish Method</em> and <em>KSK Rollover
Using the Double Signature Method</em> sections for descriptions of the default
rollover actions.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This has the potential of being a dangerous capability.  Be
<em>very</em> careful when setting up and using it.  Take care with the site-specific
commands to be executed and the permissions and ownership of <strong>rollerd</strong> and
its data files.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="dnssec_tools_configuration_file_changes">DNSSEC-Tools Configuration File Changes</a></h3>
<p>The DNSSEC-Tools configuration file must be modified to tell <strong>rollerd</strong> what
must be run for the non-default rollover phase actions.  Key/value pairs may
be set for each rollover phase to control how that phase differs from the
default.</p>
<p>The value portion of the configuration entry contains the path to the
site-specific phase command, along with any arguments it might need.
Multiple commands are separated by bangs.</p>
<p>The reserved <em>default</em> command tells <strong>rollerd</strong> to use its normal rollover
action for a particular phase.  This may be combined with other commands to
provide things such as specialized logging or notifications.</p>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> will only alter the behavior of a rollover phase if the
configuration file contains an entry for that phase.  If not, the default
action will be taken.</p>
<p>For example, this configuration line tells <strong>rollerd</strong> that for ZSK rollover
phase 2, instead of using its normal <strong>zonesigner</strong> executions it should run
the <strong>hsm-signer</strong> command.</p>
<pre>
    prog-zsk2        hsm-signer</pre>
<p>In this example, this configuration line informs <strong>rollerd</strong> that when entering
KSK rollover phase 1 and ZSK rollover phase 1, it should execute the
<strong>log-and-mail</strong> command, then use the normal rollover action for those phases.</p>
<pre>
    prog-ksk1        /usr/local/sbin/log-and-mail mary ! default
    prog-zsk1        /usr/local/sbin/log-and-mail bob!default</pre>
<p>The following configuration keys are used for controlling KSK rollover
phases: <em>prog-ksk1</em>, <em>prog-ksk2</em>, <em>prog-ksk3</em>, <em>prog-ksk4</em>, <em>prog-ksk5</em>,
<em>prog-ksk6</em>, and <em>prog-ksk7</em>,</p>
<p>The following configuration keys are used for controlling ZSK rollover phases:
<em>prog-zsk1</em>, <em>prog-zsk2</em>, <em>prog-zsk3</em>, and <em>prog-zsk4</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>prog-normal</em> configuration key controls the normal, non-rollover state.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="site_specific_commands">Site-Specific Commands</a></h3>
<p>To be generally useful, the site-specific commands executed by <strong>rollerd</strong>
will be given a standard set of arguments, and a standard set of exit
values will be recognized.</p>
<p>The standard arguments from <strong>rollerd</strong> are:
    1. zonename - Zone to be handled.
    2. phase - Zone's current rollover phase (e.g., zsk1, ksk6, normal.)
    3. rollrec name - Zone's entry key in the rollrec file.
    4. rollrec file - The path to the rollrec file.
    5. keyrec file - The path to the zone's keyrec file.</p>
<p>The <em>prog-phase</em> entry in the configuration file may specify additional
options and arguments for a command.  These will be included on the execution
command line <em>prior</em> to the standard arguments.</p>
<p>The standard exit values expected by <strong>rollerd</strong> are:
    0. The zone can move to the next rollover phase.
       This is only applicable to the current command; other
       commands in this phase's command list must still be run.
    1. The zone should stay in the current rollover phase.
       This is not necessarily the result of an error.
    2. An error was found in the arguments given to the command.
    3. An error was encountered during execution.</p>
<p>If a rollover phase's configuration entry lists multiple commands, they will
be executed in the order listed.  If any command in that command list fails,
processing stops there.</p>
<p>The <strong>rp-wrapper</strong> command shows how a site-specific command may be written.
<strong>rp-wrapper</strong> may be used as a skeleton on which to build a more useful
rollover-phase command.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="considerations_for_site_specific_commands">Considerations for Site-Specific Commands</a></h3>
<p>The following should be taken into consideration when writing a site-specific
command for a rollover phase.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="execution_length" class="item">execution length</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>A phase command should not execute very long.  As currently written, <strong>rollerd</strong>
serializes zone rollover.  So the longer a phase command takes to execute, the
longer it will take to get to the next zone.  If a phase command sleeps or
actively waits, so to speak, for the next phase timeout, then every zone
<strong>rollerd</strong> manages will be left waiting.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="follow_interface_guidelines" class="item">follow interface guidelines</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Follow the standards for arguments and exit values.  Not following the
standards is likely to negatively affect zone rollover.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="frequency_of_command_execution" class="item">frequency of command execution</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>If <strong>rollerd</strong> is operating in its traditional &quot;full list&quot; processing mode, a
phase command list will be executed every time <strong>rollerd</strong> cycles through its
zone list and a zone is in that particular command's phase.  For example, if
&lt;i&gt;prog_zsk1&lt;/i&gt; is defined for example.com, that command list will be
executed for example.com every time <strong>rollerd</strong> runs its zone list and finds
example.com is in the ZSK phase 1 rollover state.  A phase command <strong>must</strong> take
this into account so it doesn't perform its actions more frequently than
necessary.  This is most likely an issue for the various rollover wait states,
and possibly the normal state.</p>
<p>If <strong>rollerd</strong> is operating in the experimental &quot;soon queue&quot; processing mode, a
phase command list will be executed for a zone only when a phase change
occurs.  Since phase changes are time queued, this should not happen more than
once per phase.  A phase command <strong>should</strong> take this into account, in case the
soon queue is reordered before the zone leaves the queue, or queue timing is
relatively swift.  This is most likely an issue for the various rollover wait
states.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong>  &quot;soon queue&quot; processing is <em>experimental</em>.  Care should be taken
when using this processing method, as it may still have some lingering bugs.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="zone_reloading">Zone Reloading</a></h2>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> has the opportunity to inform the DNS daemon to reload a zone in
KSK phase 2, KSK phase 7, ZSK phase 2, and ZSK phase 4.  This is the
<strong>rollerd</strong>'s default behavior.  However, there are situations where this
shouldn't be done, such as for off-line signing.</p>
<p>The <strong>roll_loadzone</strong> field of the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file is a boolean
field that overrides the default to force the zone-reload behavior either on
or off.  This field takes precedence over the default.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <strong>-noreload</strong> option prevents <strong>rollerd</strong> from requesting a zone
reload, and it takes precedence over the <strong>roll_loadzone</strong> configuration field
and the default.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="rollrec_files"><em>rollrec</em> Files</a></h2>
<p>The zones to be managed by <strong>rollerd</strong> are described in a <em>rollrec</em>
file.  Generally speaking most people will want to use the <strong>rollinit</strong>
command to create an initial <em>rollrec</em> file instead of typing their
own from scratch.  See the INITIALIZATION AND USAGE section below and
the <strong>rollinit</strong> manual page for details. Each zone's entry contains
data needed by <strong>rollerd</strong> and some data useful to a user.  Below is a
sample <em>rollrec</em> entry:</p>
<pre>
        roll &quot;example.com&quot;
                zonename        &quot;example.com&quot;
                zonefile        &quot;example.com.signed&quot;
                keyrec          &quot;example.com.krf&quot;
                zonegroup       &quot;demo-zones&quot;
                directory       &quot;dir-example.com&quot;
                kskphase        &quot;0&quot;
                zskphase        &quot;3&quot;
                ksk_rollsecs    &quot;1172614842&quot;
                ksk_rolldate    &quot;Tue Feb 27 22:20:42 2007&quot;
                zsk_rollsecs    &quot;1172615087&quot;
                zsk_rolldate    &quot;Tue Feb 27 22:24:47 2007&quot;
                maxttl          &quot;60&quot;
                display         &quot;1&quot;
                phasestart      &quot;Tue Feb 27 22:25:07 2007&quot;
                # optional records for RFC5011 rolling:
                istrustanchor   &quot;no&quot;
                holddowntime    &quot;60D&quot;</pre>
<p>The first line gives the <em>rollrec</em> entry's name.  The name distinguishes it
from other <em>rollrec</em> entries and must be unique.  This may be the zone's
name, but this is not a requirement.  The following lines give the zone's
name, the zone's signed zone file, <em>keyrec</em> file, the current rollover
phases, the rollover timestamps, and other information.  The zone group is
optional and allows a set of related zones to be controlled with a single
<strong>rollctl</strong> execution, rather than one execution per zone.</p>
<p>If either of the <em>zonefile</em> or <em>keyrec</em> files do not exist, then a &quot;roll&quot;
<em>rollrec</em> will be changed into a &quot;skip&quot; <em>rollrec</em>.  That record will not be
processed.</p>
<p>A more detailed explanation may be found in <em>rollrec(5)</em>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="directories">Directories</a></h2>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong>'s execution directory is either the directory in which it is
executed or the directory passed in the <strong>-directory</strong> command-line option.
Any files used by <strong>rollerd</strong> that were not specified with absolute paths use
this directory as their base.</p>
<p>A <em>rollrec</em> file's <em>directory</em> field informs <strong>rollerd</strong> where the zone's
files may be found.  For that zone, <strong>rollerd</strong> will move into that directory,
then return to its execution directory when it finishes rollover operations
for that zone.  If the <em>directory</em> value is a relative path, it will be
appended to <strong>rollerd</strong>'s execution directory.  If the <em>directory</em> value is an
absolute path, it will be used as is.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="controlling_rollerd_with_rollctl">Controlling <strong>rollerd</strong> with <strong>rollctl</strong></a></h2>
<p>The <strong>rollctl</strong> command is used to control the behavior of <strong>rollerd</strong>.  A
number of commands are available, such as starting or stopping rollover for a
selected zone or all zones, turning on or off a GUI rollover display, and
halting <strong>rollerd</strong> execution.  The communications path between <strong>rollerd</strong> and
<strong>rollctl</strong> is operating system-dependent.  On Unix-like systems, it is a Unix
pipe that should <strong>only</strong> be writable by the user which runs <em>rollerd</em>.  A
more detailed explanation of <strong>rollctl</strong> may be found in <em>rollctl(8)</em>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="a_note_about_files_and_filenames">A Note About Files and Filenames</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of files and filenames used by <strong>rollerd</strong> and
<strong>zonesigner</strong>.  The user must be aware of the files used by these programs,
where the files are located, and where the programs are executed.</p>
<p>By default, <strong>rollerd</strong> will change directory to the DNSSEC-Tools directory,
though this may be changed by the <strong>-directory</strong> option.  Any programs started
by <strong>rollerd</strong>, most importantly <strong>zonesigner</strong>, will run in this same
directory.  If files and directories referenced by these programs are named
with relative paths, those paths must be relative to this directory.</p>
<p>The <em>rollrec</em> entry name is used as a key to the <em>rollrec</em> file and to the
zone's <em>keyrec</em> file.  This entry does not have to be the name of the
entry's domain, but it is a very good idea to make it so.  Whatever is used
for this entry name, the same name <strong>must</strong> be used for the zone <em>keyrec</em> in
that zone's <em>keyrec</em> file.</p>
<p>It is probably easiest to store <em>rollrec</em> files, <em>keyrec</em> files, zone
files, and key files in a single directory.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="initialization_and_usage">INITIALIZATION AND USAGE</a></h1>
<p>The following steps must be taken to initialize and use <strong>rollerd</strong>.  This
assumes that zone files have been created, and that BIND and DNSSEC-Tools
have been installed.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="sign_zones" class="item">sign zones</a></strong>

<p>The zones to be managed by <strong>rollerd</strong> must be signed.  Use <strong>zonesigner</strong> to
create the signed zone files and the <em>keyrec</em> files needed by <strong>rollerd</strong>.
The <em>rollrec</em> file created in the next step <strong>must</strong> use the <em>keyrec</em> file
names and the signed zone file names created here.</p>
<p>This step is optional.  If it is bypassed, then (in step 4 and later)
<strong>rollerd</strong> will perform the initial key creation and zone signing of your
zones using the defaults found in the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file.
<strong>rollerd</strong> determines if it must perform these initial operations by whether
it can find the <em>keyrec</em> file for a zone (as specified in the <em>rollrec</em>
file.  If it can't, it performs the initial operations; if it can, it assumes
the zone's initial operations have been performed.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="create_rollrec_file" class="item">create <em>rollrec</em> file</a></strong>

<p>Before <strong>rollerd</strong> may be used, a <em>rollrec</em> file must first be created.
While this file may be built by hand, the <strong>rollinit</strong> command was
written specifically to build the file.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="select_operational_parameters" class="item">select operational parameters</a></strong>

<p>A number of <strong>rollerd</strong>'s operational parameters are taken from the
DNSSEC-Tools configuration file.  However, these may be overridden
by command-line options.  See the OPTIONS section below for more details.
If non-standard parameters are desired to always be used, the appropriate
fields in the DNSSEC-Tools configuration file may be modified to use these
values.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="install_the_rollover_configuration" class="item">install the rollover configuration</a></strong>

<p>The complete rollover configuration -- <strong>rollerd</strong>, <em>rollrec</em> file,
DNSSEC-Tools configuration file values, zone files -- should be installed.
The appropriate places for these locations are both installation-dependent
and operating system-dependent.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="test_the_rollover_configuration" class="item">test the rollover configuration</a></strong>

<p>The complete rollover configuration should be tested.</p>
<p>Edit the zone files so that their zones have short TTL values.  A minute TTL
should be sufficient.  Test rollovers of this speed should <strong>only</strong> be done
in a test environment without the real signed zone.</p>
<p>Run the following command:</p>
<pre>
    rollerd -rrfile test.rollrec -logfile - -loglevel info -sleep 60</pre>
<p>This command assumes the test <em>rollrec</em> file is <strong>test.rollrec</strong>.  It writes
a fair amount of log messages to the terminal, and checks its queue every 60
seconds.  Follow the messages to ensure that the appropriate actions, as
required by the Pre-Publish Method, are taking place.</p>
</li>

<h1><a name="options">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p>There are a number of operational parameters that define how <strong>rollerd</strong> works.
These parameters define things such as the <em>rollrec</em> file, the logging level,
and the log file.  These parameters can be set in the DNSSEC-Tools
configuration file or given as options on the <strong>rollerd</strong> command line.
The command line options override values in the configuration file.</p>
<p>The following options are recognized:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="alwayssign" class="item"><strong>-alwayssign</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Tells <strong>rollerd</strong> to sign the zones that aren't in the middle of being
rolled.  This allows <strong>rollerd</strong> to refresh signed zone signatures and
allows complete management of zone signing to be taken over by <strong>rollerd</strong>.</p>
<p>The downside to using this option is that all the non-rolling zones will be
signed after every sleep, which may be expensive computationally.</p>
<p>Note:  The zone files are not updated or installed at this time.
Manual copying and installation are still needed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="autosign_noautosign" class="item"><strong>-autosign</strong> | <strong>-noautosign</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Automatic zone-signing flag.  If this is set, then a zone's zonefile will
be re-signed (and only re-signed) if it is found to be newer than the
corresponding signed zonefile.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="directory_dir" class="item"><strong>-directory dir</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sets the <strong>rollerd</strong> execution directory.  This must be a valid directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="display" class="item"><strong>-display</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Starts the <strong>blinkenlights</strong> graphical display program to show the status of
zones managed by <strong>rollerd</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="dtconfig_config_file" class="item"><strong>-dtconfig config_file</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Name of an alternate DNSSEC-Tools configuration file to be processed.
If specified, this configuration file is used <em>in place</em> of the normal
DNSSEC-Tools configuration file <strong>not</strong> in addition to it.  Also, it will be
handled prior to <em>keyrec</em> files, <em>rollrec</em> files, and command-line options.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="foreground" class="item"><strong>-foreground</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Run in the foreground and do not fork into a daemon.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="logfile_log_file" class="item"><strong>-logfile log_file</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sets the <strong>rollerd</strong> log file to <em>log_file</em>.
This must be a valid logging file, meaning that if <em>log_file</em> already
exists, it must be a regular file.  The only exceptions to this are if
<em>logfile</em> is <strong>/dev/stdout</strong>, <strong>/dev/tty</strong>, <strong>-</strong>.  Of these three, using a
<em>log_file</em> of <strong>-</strong> is preferable since Perl will properly convert the <strong>-</strong>
to the process' standard output.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="loglevel_level" class="item"><strong>-loglevel level</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sets <strong>rollerd</strong>'s logging level to <em>level</em>.  <strong>rollmgr.pm(3)</strong> contains a list
of the valid logging levels.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="noreload" class="item"><strong>-noreload</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Prevents <strong>rollerd</strong> from telling the DNS daemon to reload zones.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="parameters" class="item"><strong>-parameters</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Prints a set of <strong>rollerd</strong> parameters and then exits.  This shows the
parameters with which <strong>rollerd</strong> will execute, but very little parameter
validation is performed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="pidfile_pid_file" class="item"><strong>-pidfile pid_file</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Stores the running process PID into <em>pid_file</em>.  This defaults to
<strong>/var/run/rollerd.pid</strong> on most systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="rrfile_rollrec_file" class="item"><strong>-rrfile rollrec_file</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Name of the <em>rollrec</em> file to be processed.  This is the only required
&quot;option&quot;.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="realm_realm_name" class="item"><strong>-realm realm_name</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Name of the realm in which <strong>rollerd</strong> is running.  This is for use with the
DNSSEC-Tools realms facility as a means of easily identifying different
instantiations of <strong>rollerd</strong>.  It is informational only (e.g., <strong>ps</strong> output
and log files) and is not used for anything else.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="singlerun" class="item"><strong>-singlerun</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Processes all needed steps once and exits.  This is not the ideal way to run
<strong>rollerd</strong>, but it is potentially useful for environments where keying
material is only available when specific hardware tokens have been made
available.</p>
<p>The timing between the steps will be potentially longer since the
time between <strong>rollerd</strong> runs is dependent on when <strong>rollerd</strong> is executed.
&quot;cmd&quot; lines must be added to the <em>rollrec</em> file to do particular actions.</p>
<p>The following lines should serve as examples:</p>
<pre>
  cmd &quot;rollzsk example.com&quot;
  cmd &quot;rollksk example.com&quot;
  cmd &quot;dspub example.com&quot;   # (for when the parent publishes
                            # the new ksk)</pre>
<p>The <em>-singlerun</em> option implicitly implies <em>-foreground</em> as well.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="sleep_sleeptime" class="item"><strong>-sleep sleeptime</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sets <strong>rollerd</strong>'s sleep time to <em>sleeptime</em>.  The sleep time is the amount
of time (in seconds) <strong>rollerd</strong> waits between processing its <em>rollrec</em>-based
queue.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="username_username" class="item"><strong>-username username</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p><strong>username</strong> is the user for which the <strong>rollerd</strong> daemon will be executed.
The <strong>rollerd</strong> process' effective uid will be set to the uid corresponding
to <strong>username</strong>.</p>
<p>If <strong>username</strong> is a username, it must correspond to a valid uid; if it is
a uid, it must correspond to a valid username.</p>
<p>If <strong>rollerd</strong> does not have the appropriate O/S magic (e.g., for Unix,
installed as <em>setuid</em> program and owned by root) then it will only be able
to switch to those users to which the executing user has privilege to switch.
This restriction is dependent on the operating system and the manner by which
<strong>rollerd</strong> is installed.</p>
<p>When using this option, the target user must have access to the various
directories, logs, and data files that <strong>rollerd</strong> requires to execute.
Without this access, proper execution cannot occur.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="zsargs_arglist" class="item"><strong>-zsargs arglist</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Additional <strong>zonesigner</strong> arguments that will be passed to all <strong>zonesigner</strong>
executions. These arguments will override the corresponding arguments in the
DNSSEC-Tools configuration file, and the zones' <em>keyrec</em> files.  If a zone's
<strong>rollrec</strong> entry contains a <em>zsargs</em> field, then it will be used instead of
those specified by this argument.</p>
<p>Given the <strong>rollerd</strong> argument processing, the new arguments for <strong>zonesigner</strong>
cannot be specified as expected.  Instead, the arguments should be given in
the following manner.  The leading dash should be replaced with an equals sign.
If the option takes an argument, the space that would separate the option from
the option's argument should also be replaced by an equals sign.  If multiple
arguments will be passed via <strong>-zsargs</strong>, quotes must be used to group them
into a single argument.</p>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> translates these arguments to the appropriate format for
<strong>zonesigner</strong>.  These examples should clarify the modifications:</p>
<pre>
    normal zonesigner option     rollerd -zsargs option
    ------------------------     ----------------------
    -nokrfile                    -zsargs =nokrfile
    -zskcount 5 -kskcount 3      -zsargs &quot;=zskcount=5 =kskcount=3&quot;</pre>
</dd>

<h1><a name="assumptions">ASSUMPTIONS</a></h1>
<p><strong>rollerd</strong> uses the <strong>rndc</strong> command to communicate with the BIND
<strong>named</strong> daemon.  Therefore, it assumes that appropriate measures have been
taken so that this communication is possible.</p>

<dd>
<p>Any process that can write to the rollover socket can send commands to
