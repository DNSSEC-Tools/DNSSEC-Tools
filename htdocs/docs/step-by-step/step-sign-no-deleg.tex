\subsection{Signing a Zone with No Delegations}
\label{signzone-nodel}

A zone needs to be re-signed when \underline{any} change is made to it.
Steps~\ref{keygen-set-nodel} and~\ref{signzone-nodeleg-updzf}
must be followed if the zone has not been previously signed.
Steps~\ref{check-zonefile-unsigned-nodeleg}~-~\ref{signzone-nodel-last}
must be followed when re-signing a zone file that has no
delegations.

\subsubsection{Sign the Zone}
\label{signzone-no-deleg}

Use the \cmd{dnssec-signzone} command to sign the zone file.

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\$ {\bf dnssec-signzone -k \underline{/path/to}/K\underline{zone.name}.+005+\underline{ksktag}.key} \\
\hspace{0.5in} {\bf -o \underline{zone.name} -e +2592000 \underline{zonefile}} \\
\hspace{0.5in} {\bf \underline{/path/to}/K\underline{zone.name}.+005+\underline{zsktag-cur}.key} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in} \underline{zonefile}.signed \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ \\
\end{tabbing}

Signature generation may take a few minutes to complete, depending on the size
of the zone file. If the above operation appears to be unresponsive for an
unreasonable length of time, use pseudorandom numbers (using the {\it -p}
option) instead.

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\$ {\bf dnssec-signzone -k \underline{/path/to}/K\underline{zone.name}.+005+\underline{ksktag}.key} \\
\hspace{0.5in} {\bf -o \underline{zone.name} -p -e +2592000 \underline{zonefile}} \\
\hspace{0.5in} {\bf \underline{/path/to}/K\underline{zone.name}.+005+\underline{zsktag-cur}.key} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in} \underline{zonefile}.signed \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ \\
\end{tabbing}

Three files are created by \cmd{dnssec-signzone}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Signed zone file in \underline{zonefile}.signed.
The {\it .signed} suffix is appended by default.

\item Keyset file in keyset-\underline{zone.name}.
May have to be sent to the parent zone; see Section~\ref{delegation-child}.

\item DS-set file in dsset-\underline{zone.name}.
Used to verify that the correct DS record was generated at the parent;
see Section~\ref{delegation-child}.

\end{itemize}

This \cmd{dnssec-signzone} command generates signatures for the records that
are valid for 30 days (2,592,000 seconds) from the current time.  This
is offset by -1 hour to account for clock skew between the name server and
DNSSEC validators.
