\subsection{Configuring and Serving a Signed Zone}
\label{config-n-serve}

Several configuration files must be modified in order to serve a signed zone.
Follow the steps below to configure your name server and have it start
serving your signed zone.

\path{named.conf} is the name of the configuration file used in these examples.
The configuration file may vary according to the needs of the administrator.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Add the Signed Zone to the Name Server Configuration File}

The name of the signed zone file must be added to the name server's
configuration file.  For the zone whose name is \underline{zone.name},
do the following:
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in} \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \kill \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ {\bf vi named.conf} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in} ... \\
\hspace{0.5in} zone "\underline{zone.name}." \{ \\
\hspace{0.5in} \> \> type master; \\
\hspace{0.5in} \> \> file "\underline{zonefile}.signed"; \\
\hspace{0.5in} \}; \\
\hspace{0.5in} ... \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ \\
\end{tabbing}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Enable DNSSEC}

Add the \option{dnssec-enable yes;} option to the \path{named.conf} file.
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in} \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= \kill \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ {\bf vi named.conf} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in} ... \\
\hspace{0.5in} options \{ \\
\hspace{0.5in} \> \> ... \\
\hspace{0.5in} \> \> dnssec-enable yes; \\
\hspace{0.5in} \}; \\
\hspace{0.5in} ... \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ \\
\end{tabbing}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Check the Name Server Configuration File for Errors}

You must ensure that the configuration file modifications were performed
correctly.  The \cmd{named-checkconf} command will perform this verification.
No output indicates that all is well with the zone.

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\$ {\bf named-checkconf \underline{named.conf}} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ \\
\end{tabbing}

\input{zone-reload}

\subsubsection{Check that the Zone Loaded Properly}

Confirm that the SOA serial number of the zone corresponds to the most
recent value.

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\$ {\bf dig @\underline{server-IP-address} SOA \underline{zone.name}} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in} ; $<$$<$$>$$>$ DiG 9.3.0 $<$$<$$>$$>$ ... \\
\hspace{0.5in} ... \\
\hspace{0.5in} ;; flags: qr aa rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0 \\
\hspace{0.5in} ... \\
\hspace{0.5in} ;;ANSWER SECTION \\
\hspace{0.5in} 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \kill
\hspace{0.5in} \underline{zone.name} \> \> 3600 \> IN \> SOA \> servername contact ( \\
\hspace{0.5in}	\> \> \> \> 2005092101 ; This should be the most  \\
\hspace{0.5in}	\> \> \> \> \> ; recent value. \\
\hspace{0.5in}	\> \> \> \> \> ; This value will most \\
\hspace{0.5in}	\> \> \> \> \> ; likely be different in \\
\hspace{0.5in}	\> \> \> \> \> ; your zone file. \\
\hspace{0.5in}				... \\
\hspace{0.5in} \> ) \\
\hspace{0.5in}... \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ \\

\end{tabbing}
