\subsubsection{Re-Sign the Zone DNSKEY RRset with the Current and Published KSK}

ZSKs sign the zone data, whereas KSKs sign the RRset for all DNSKEYs 
recognized by the zone. There is no direct way to create the signed DNSKEY
RRset for the zone; it is only formed as a by-product of the 
\cmd{dnssec-signzone} operation.

Follow steps
\ref{check-zonefile-unsigned-nodeleg}~--~\ref{signzone-nodel-last}
if the zone does no delegation.  Follow steps
\ref{check-zonefile-unsigned-deleg}~--~\ref{signzone-deleg-last}
if the zone does delegation.  The ZSK used in the signing process in
Section~\ref{signzone-no-deleg} or~\ref{signzone-has-deleg} must be the key
that is marked as the Current key (C) in the key-tag table. Both Current KSK
and the Published KSK must be simultaneously included in the
\cmd{dnssec-signzone} operation (by using two \option{-k} options).
