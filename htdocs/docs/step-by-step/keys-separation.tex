\subsubsection{Store Separately the Private Keys for ZSKs and KSKs}

Storing the private keys for ZSKs and KSKs off-line is considered a good
security practice.  ZSK and KSK separation lessens the operational burden
during zone-key compromise, but only if the KSK is still considered safe for
use.  In cases where a signed zone is also updated via dynamic updates, the
ZSK will need to be on-line and available to the name server process.  To
avoid a common vulnerability point (such as compromise of the system on which
these keys reside), store the KSKs in a place that is considered safer.
