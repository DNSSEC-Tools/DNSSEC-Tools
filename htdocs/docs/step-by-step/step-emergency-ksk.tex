\subsection{KSK Roll-Over --- KSK Compromise}
\label{roll-emergency-ksk}

The emergency procedures described for key roll-over use the rationale that
injection of valid but false data (which can be generated using the
compromised key) is more serious than discontinuity in our ability to validate
true data. Thus, during emergency KSK roll-over, there will be a period (up
to twice the maximum zone TTL) where it may not be possible to build an
``authentication chain'' from the zone data to the new KSK.

See Figure~\ref{fig:kskroll-emerg}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Inform Parent about the KSK Compromise}

This communication between parent and child must be done securely using
out-of-band mechanisms.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Wait for the Parent to Remove the Zone's DS Record}

Before proceeding, wait for the parent zone to remove the DS record.  This
may be found by using the \cmd{dig} command to retrieve the parent's DS record.

The \option{aa} flag in the result must be set and no answer should be
returned for the DS query.

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\$ {\bf dig @\underline{parent-IP-address} DS \underline{zone.name}} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in} ; $<$$<$$>$$>$ DiG 9.3.0 $<$$<$$>$$>$ ... \\
\hspace{0.5in} ... \\
\hspace{0.5in} ;; flags: qr aa rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0 \\
\hspace{0.5in} ... \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ \\
\end{tabbing}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Generate a New KSK}

Follow the steps in Section~\ref{genksk} for generation of a new KSK.  Update
the key-tag table with the New KSK.  Delete the Current KSK.  Mark the status
of the New KSK as Current (C).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Zone} &
\multicolumn{4}{c|}{{\bf ZSK}} &
\multicolumn{4}{c|}{{\bf KSK}} &
{\bf Exp} \\
\cline{2-9}

 & Tag & Size & Creat & S & Tag & Size & Creat & S & \\
\hline

\underline{zone.name}				&
\underline{zsktag-cur}				&
512						&
\underline{date}				&
C						&
{\bf \sout{\underline{ksktag-cur}}}		&
{\bf \sout{1024}}				&
{\bf \sout{\underline{date}}}			&
{\bf \sout{C}}					&
\underline{date}				\\

\cline{2-9}

			&
\underline{zsktag-pub}	&
512			&
\underline{date}	&
P			&
{\bf \underline{ksktag-new}}		&
{\bf 1024}			&
{\bf \underline{date}}			&
{\bf C}			&
			\\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Modify the Zone File}

The zone file must be modified to account for the key changes.  The Current
ZSK must be deleted and the New ZSK must be added.  Also, the SOA serial
number must be changed so that the zone file's new contents will be recognized.

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in} \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \kill \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ {\bf vi \underline{zonefile}} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in}\underline{zone.name}        IN     SOA        servername contact ( \\
\hspace{3.5in}{\bf 2005092106} ; Increase current value by 1. \\
\hspace{4.4in};  This value may be different \\
\hspace{4.4in}; in your zone file. \\
\hspace{0.5in}\>           \>         ... \\
\hspace{0.5in}\>              ) \\
\hspace{0.5in}... \\
\hspace{0.5in}{\bf \sout{;; cur ksk}} \\
\hspace{0.5in}{\bf \sout{\$INCLUDE ``/path/to/K\underline{zone.name}.+005+\underline{ksktag-cur}.key''}} \\
\hspace{0.5in}{\bf ;; new ksk} \\
\hspace{0.5in}{\bf \$INCLUDE ``/path/to/K\underline{zone.name}.+005+\underline{ksktag-pub}.key''} \\
\hspace{0.5in};; pub zsk \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$INCLUDE ``/path/to/K\underline{zone.name}.+005+\underline{zsktag-pub}.key'' \\
\hspace{0.5in};; new zsk \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$INCLUDE ``/path/to/K\underline{zone.name}.+005+\underline{zsktag-new}.key'' \\
\hspace{0.5in}... \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ \\
\end{tabbing}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Regenerate the ZSKs}
\label{emerg-regen-zsks}

The ZSKs can no longer be trusted.  Follow the steps in~\ref{regen-zsks}
and~\ref{update-zonefile-newzsks} to create a new Current ZSK and Published
ZSK.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Sign the Zone with the Current ZSK and the Current KSK}

Follow steps 
\ref{check-zonefile-unsigned-nodeleg}~--~\ref{signzone-nodel-last}   
if the zone does no delegation.  Follow steps
\ref{check-zonefile-unsigned-deleg}~--~\ref{signzone-deleg-last} 
if the zone does delegation.  The ZSK used in the signing process in
Section~\ref{signzone-no-deleg} or~\ref{signzone-has-deleg} must be the key
that is marked as the Current key (C) in the key-tag table.
The KSK is the new key, which has been marked with the
status Current.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Perform Steps in Section~\ref{delegation-child} if this Zone is a Secure Delegation from Another Zone}

Send the keyset generated from the zone-signing process
in~\ref{emerg-regen-zsks} to the parent in order to complete the secure
delegation.
