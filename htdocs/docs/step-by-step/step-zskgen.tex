\subsubsection{Update the Key-Tags Table}

Keep a record of the key-tags that currently refer to ZSKs.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Zone} &
\multicolumn{4}{c|}{{\bf ZSK}} &
\multicolumn{4}{c|}{{\bf KSK}} &
{\bf Exp} \\
\cline{2-9}

 & Tag & Size & Creat & S & Tag & Size & Creat & S & \\
\hline

\underline{zone.name} & \underline{zsktag} & 512 & \underline{date} & & & & & & \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Leave the status field (S) empty for now.
