\section{Essential Preliminaries}
\markboth{Step-by-Step DNS Security Operator Guidance Document - version 0.5}{Step-by-Step DNS Security Operator Guidance Document - version 0.5}
\label{preliminaries}

The following sections must be read before proceeding with the rest of this
guide.

The steps in Sections~\ref{check-random} and~\ref{check-bind} {\bf MUST} be
taken prior to following any other steps.  Section~\ref{zone-serials}'s
discussion of this guides use of zone file serial numbers {\bf MUST} be
understood prior to following any other steps.  Failure to do any of these
three could affect the security of your zone.

Section~\ref{key-tags-tables} describes {\it key-tags} tables, which are used
to manage DNSSEC information about encryption keys and signed zones.  This
section should be understood prior to reading the remainder of the document.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Check for Randomness}
\label{check-random}

Key generation and zone signing require random data to create strong
cryptographic material.  The \cmd{dnssec-keygen} and \cmd{dnssec-signzone}
commands default to using random data from \path{/dev/random}.  Use this test
to verify that \path{/dev/random} will provide data when requested:

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in} \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \kill \\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ {\bf dd if=/dev/random bs=2 count=10 $|$ od -x} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in}...\\
\hspace{0.5in}\$ \\
\end{tabbing}

The above command checks if \path{/dev/random} is able to provide random data
when queried; it does not check to see that the data provided is truly random.

If this command provides data immediately, then \path{/dev/random} will
provide the data you need.  If it hangs, then \cmd{dnssec-keygen} and
\cmd{dnssec-signzone} won't be able to retrieve random data from
\path{/dev/random}.

% If this check for randomness fails, pseudorandom numbers can be used instead
% [6].  However, using pseudorandom numbers significantly affects the quality
% of the crypto material.  A more appropriate measure would be to run the
% key-generation and zone-signing operations on a different system that has
% \path{/dev/random} and the ability to generate good random data [2].

If this check for randomness fails, pseudorandom numbers can be used instead.

\subsection{Check for Correct Version of BIND}
\label{check-bind}

BIND version 9.3.0 (or later) is {\bf required} for use with this document.
Before following any of these instructions, you {\bf must} ensure that you
have the correct version of BIND.

The BIND version may be verified by checking the version of
\cmd{dnssec-keygen}:

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in} \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \= 12345678 \kill \\
\hspace{0.5in} \$ {\bf dnssec-keygen -h} $[$ENTER$]$ \\
\hspace{0.5in} Usage: \\
\hspace{0.5in} \>dnssec-keygen -a alg -b bits -n type [options] name \\
\hspace{0.5in} Version: 9.3.0 \\
\hspace{0.5in} ...... \\
\hspace{0.5in} \$
\end{tabbing}

If the version is incorrect, you must install the correct version of BIND
before proceeding.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Zone File Serial Numbers}
\label{zone-serials}

This guide contains a number of instructions to update a zone file.  In each,
it is indicated that the zone file's serial number must be updated.  The
actual serial numbers used will depend on each installation's preferred method
of using serial numbers.  The method used in this document is YYYYMMDDNN,
where:
\begin{packed}
\item {\bf YYYY} - year
\item {\bf MM} - month
\item {\bf DD} - day
\item {\bf NN} - incrementing number
\end{packed}

For example, the third zone file change on January 9, 2005, would be given
as 2005090103.

The serial numbers used in this guide are {\it generally} increasing
throughout the document.  More importantly, however, the numbers used within
each section are {\it always} increasing.

Some sections of this guide direct you to perform steps in other sections.
Regardless of the serial numbers given in these steps, your zone file's serial
numbers {\bf must} increase with each modification or your changes will not
be seen.

\subsection{Key-Tags Tables}
\label{key-tags-tables}

Data about results of the different steps described in this document must be
retained for use in other steps.  These data include such things as the names
of generated keys, key status, and the date a zone was signed.  While these
data may be kept in whatever form an administrator finds most convenient,
this guide stores them in a {\it key-tags table}.

A key-tags table stores a zone name, the zone's ZSK keys, the zone's KSK keys,
and the zone's expiration date.  The following is a template of how the
key-tags table is used in this document.  Data about the zone's KSK, Current
ZSK, Published ZSK, and New ZSK are stored here:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Zone} &
\multicolumn{4}{c|}{{\bf ZSK}} &
\multicolumn{4}{c|}{{\bf KSK}} &
{\bf Exp} \\
\cline{2-9}

 & Tag & Size & Creat & S & Tag & Size & Creat & S & \\
\hline

			&
\underline{zsktag-cur}	&
512			&
\underline{date}	&
C			&
\underline{ksktag}	&
1024			&
\underline{date}	&

\cline{2-9}

\underline{zone.name}	&
\underline{zsktag-pub}	&
512			&
\underline{date}	&
P			&
& & & & \\

			&
\underline{zsktag-new}	&
512			&
\underline{date}	&
N			&
& & & & \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The {\it -cur}, {\it -pub}, and {\it -new} suffixes used in this key-tags
table and in the rest of this guide are used for illustration purposes only.
They are not intended to be used in the key-tags table for an operational
zone.  Similarly, for convenience and identification purposes the tags are
retained with particular keys even when the status changes.

The following is an example key-tags table containing non-template data.
There are entries for two zones:  {\it example.com} and {\it example.net}.
There are entries for a example.com's Current KSK, New KSK, Current ZSK,
Published ZSK, and New ZSK.  example.net's entries are for its Current KSK,
Current ZSK, and Published ZSK.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Zone} &
\multicolumn{4}{c|}{{\bf ZSK}} &

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

As stated above, this information may be kept in whatever form each
administrator finds convenient.  Some administrators may want to have separate
key-tags tables for each zone for which they are responsible; others may wish
to maintain all their zones in a single table.

A blank template key-tags table may be found in Appendix~\ref{app-keytags}.
Additional versions (PostScript, Excel spreadsheet) may be found on
