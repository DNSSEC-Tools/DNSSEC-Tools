{\bf NAME}

\cmd{rolllog} - DNSSEC-Tools utility to write messages to the DNSSEC rollover
log file

{\bf SYNOPSIS}

\begin{verbatim}
  rolllog -loglevel <level> <log_message>
\end{verbatim}

{\bf DESCRIPTION}

The \cmd{rolllog} program writes log messages to the DNSSEC rollover log
file.  \cmd{rolllog} does not actually write the messages itself; rather,
it sends them to the \cmd{rollerd} rollover daemon to write the messages.
\cmd{rollerd} keeps track of a logging level, and only messages of that
level or higher are written to the log file.

{\bf OPTIONS}

The following options are recognized:

\begin{description}

\item {\bf -loglevel level}\verb" "

Logging level of this message.  The valid levels are defined in
\perlmod{rollmgr.pm}(3).   This option is required.

\item {\bf -help}\verb" "

Display a usage message.

\item {\bf -Version}\verb" "

Display a version message.
