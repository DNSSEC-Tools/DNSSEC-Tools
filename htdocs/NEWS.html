<h2>2.1</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<pre>
    - donuts:       - Added the ability to summarize information
                      about a zone in the output, such as the upcoming
                      entire zone expiry time, etc
                    - Added the ability to query live zones for
                      records to analyze.  EG:
                      donuts live:good-a,badsign-a test.dnssec-tools.org
                    - Added a -V switch to dump records analyzed
    - libval:       - Add support for conditionally checking all RRSIGs
                      on an assertion even if one that validates is
                      already found.
                    - Look for zonecuts based on NS records, not SOA
                    - Added initial support for TSIG in order to enable
                      libval to query recursive name servers that
                      authorized recursive lookup for only those hosts
                      that used a particular TSIG key.
    - Validator.pm  - Store respondent name server information in result
                      structure.
    - Owl           - additional sensor modules
                    - additional data analysis on manager
                    - logging to the Owl sensors modules
                    - optimized sensor data organization
                     (requires software upgrades on both sensor and
                      manager at the same time)
                    - added -restart option to owl-sensord for
                      restarting sensor modules
                    - improvements to the installation guide
    - rollerd       - generalized zonegroup entry in rollecs to be lists of tags
                    - rndc option support added
    - dnssec-check  - Ported to Qt5
    - dnssec-nodes  - Ported to Qt5
    - lookup        - Ported to Qt5
    - dnssec-system-tray

</pre>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<pre>
                    - Fixed bugs in libval, rollerd, blinkenlights, Owl
                      sensor modules, and Owl manager
                    - Use rlimits to try and limit file descriptor use in
                      libsres so we don't run out of available sockets.
                    - Eliminate a few hardcoded paths in various perl modules
                    - Fix various compiler warnings
                    - Update autoconf and related files
</pre>

<h2>2.0</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<h4>Bloodhound</h4>
<p> A mozilla-based DNSSEC-enabled browser with DANE support
                    - Added support for validation of SSL certificates
                      using the DANE protocol.
<h4>Owl</h4>
<p>The Owl Monitoring System uses timed DNS queries
   to monitor basic network functionality.  The system
   consists of a manager host and a set of sensor hosts.
   The Owl sensors perform periodic DNS queries and
   report to the Owl manager the time taken for each
   query.  Over time, this shows the responsiveness of
   the DNS infrastructure.
<h4>dnssec-nodes</h4>
<p> Many new features have been added:
    - The validation tree now supports clicking on
    boxes to highlight it and the arrows that derive
    from it.  Great for use when teaching about
    DNSSEC.
    - An extensive filter/effect editor now lets you
    tailor the look of a graph to color-code, set
    the alpha levels, etc of nodes based on their
    names, status, data types, etc.
    - Right clicking on a node lets you center the
    graph on that node.
    - More data types are collected and shown in the
    data view.
    - Support for arguments on the command line for
    parsing log files, pcap files and domain names.
    - The validation view has received a visual clean-up
    - Many other bug fixes
<h4>curl</h4>
<p> - Added support for validation of SSL certificates
                      using the DANE protocol.
<h4>libval</h4>
<p> - Added support for local DANE validation
    - Extended the dt-danechk commandline tool to check
    the X509 cert provided over the SSL connection
    against the TLSA record.
    - Optimized glue record lookup when the only ip
    addresses configured for the host are for a single
    address family (ipv4 or ipv6)
    - fine tune res_io source management
<h4>dnssec-check</h4>
<p> dnssec-check now checks DNAME support
<h4>rollerd</h4>
<p> A new set of steps for KSK rollover has been
    implemented.  A cache-expiration wait phase has
    been moved after the publication of DS records in
    order to allow name caches to reflect the changes.
    In addition to rollerd, supporting program have
    been modified to recognize this change.
<h4>rollrec files</h4>
<p> A new "information rollrec" has been added to the
    rollrec files.  This will allow infomration to be
    specified for the collection of rollrecs.  At this
    time, the only information stored in this rollrec
    is the version number of the rollrec file.
    In addition to the rollrec.pm Perl module, programs
    which use this module have been modified to recognize
    this change.
    If you use the rollrec.pm module, you should test
    to see if your code is affected.  The modifications
    for the info rollrec have been made to minimize
    affected programs.  If you parse the rollrec files
    yourself, you will have to account for this change.
<h4>multiple</h4>
<p> The perl-based tools can now use either the
    ZoneFile::Fast or the Net::DNS zone file parser,
    thanks to a patch from Sebastian Schmidt (yath@yath.de).
<h4>ZoneFile:Fast</h4>
<p> - Support for TLSA
    - Made it compatible with newer Net::DNS releases
<h4>Qt5</h4>
<p> - A patch to support DNSSEC checks in Qt5 DNS lookups
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<h4>zonesigner<h4>
<p> - Fixed SOA parsing and serial number update issues
<h4>libval<h4>
<p> - Properly initialize memory in sockaddr structures
    before use.



<h2>1.14</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<h4>dnssec-nodes</h4>
<p>Many new features, including validation tree

                      graphing, on-the-wire traffic display, pcap dump
                      file display, increased data logging and
                      display, improved simultaneous updating, etc.
<h4>Libval:</h4>
<p>Added initial support for the TLSA rrtype 

                    - Added support for ECDSA
                    - Implemented checking for AI_ADDRCONFIG in getaddrinfo
                    - Memory optimizations to improve speed-up
<h4>dnssec-check</h4>
<p>increased stability across all platforms.


    - All Around:   - Many bug fixes and other minor improvements

<h2>1.13</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>

<h4>rollerd:</h4>
<p>Added support for the signzone command. Allow

                      zones to be signed while in the midst of a
                      rollover wait.
                    - Added autosigning of modified zone files.  Zone
                      files are considered modified when their "last
                      modification" timestamp is more recent than that
                      of the associated signed zone file.  This
                      functionality includes adding the -autosign option
                      and config field.
                    - Added additional commands (via rollctl) to allow
                      greater control over zone rollover actions.
                    - Added -zsargs option to allow global options to
                      be passed to zonesigner.

<h4>realms:</h4>
<p>Added the realms feature to manage multiple

                      simultaneous rollover environments.  Several
                      commands and modules (e.g., dtrealms, realms.pm,
                      buildrealms) were added for the realms feature.

<h4>zonesigner:</h4>
<p>Added the -threshold option to specify a signing

                      threshold.
                    - Better handling of serial numbers in zone files.

<h4>keymod:</h4>
<p>New tool that can be used to modify key

                      generation parameters in a keyrec file.

<h4>dnssec-check</h4>
<p>significant rewrite since the 1.12 release, though

                      individual updates have been available already.
                    - Asynchronous support for non-interrupting GUI support 
                    - Letter grades assigned to each resolver
                    - Various user-interface improvements

<h4>libval:</h4>
<p>Bug fixes

                    - Renamed all validator command-line apps to have
                      a dt- prefix in order to avoid conflicts with
                      pre-existing executables in certain platforms. 

    - dnsval python module
                    - Add python wrapper module for the validator
                      library. Code contributed by Bob Novas. 
                      
<h4>trustman:</h4>
<p>Added an option for use by monitoring systems.


<h4>nagios</h4>
<p>Added the dt_donuts plugin for running trustman on

                      remote machines.
                    - Added the dt_trustman plugin for monitoring trust
                      anchors.

<h4>firefox</h4>
<p>updated nspr and firefox patches to work with

                      mozilla-central and nspr-4.9


<h4>webmin:</h4>
<p>Added the ability to perform DNSSEC 

                      operations on DNSSEC-Tools managed signed 
                      zones using the Webmin front-end. 

<h4>ssh:</h4>
<p>Update the patch for enabling local DNSSEC

                      validation to work with OpenSSH 6.0p1.




<h2>1.12.2</h2>
<h3>Bux fix release</h3>
<h4>Rollerd's</h4>
<p>alwayssign flag logic had a critical error that could

        have caused a zone to be signed with the wrong ZSK at particular
        points of the ZSK key rolling process.
   

<h2>1.12.1</h2>
<h3>Minor bug fix release</h3>
      - Fix perl Validator module so it compiles after a header move


<h2>1.12</h2>
<h3>New Features:</h3>

<h4>libval:</h4>
<p>Made improvements to support IPv6,

                      added the ability to fetch IPv6 glue
                    - Fixed the EDNS0 fallback behavior.
                    - Tidied up the locking semantics in libval. 
                    - Added support for hard-coding validator configuration 
                      information that gets used in the absence of other 
                      configuration data. This feature allows the 
                      validator library to be self-contained in 
                      environments where setting up configuration data at
                      specific locations in the file system is not always 
                      feasible.
                    - The library has been ported to the Android OS

<h4>rollerd:</h4>
<p>Added support for phase-specific commands. This allows

                      the zone operator to customize processing of the rollerd
                      utility during different rollerd phases. 
                    - Added support for zone groups.  This allows a collection
                      of zones to be controlled as a group, rather each of
                      those zones individually.
                    - Improved the manner in which rollerd indexes the zones
                      being managed, with the significantly decreased access
                      times for rollerd's data files.  This results in rollerd
                      being able to support a lot more zones with a single
                      rollerd instance.
                    - rollctl and the rollover GUI programs may have new
                      commands to allow for immediate termination of rollerd.

<h4>apps</h4>
<p>Added patch to enable local validation in NTP, with

                      the ability to handle a specific chicken and egg problem 
                      related to the interdependency between DNSSEC and an
                      accurate system clock.

                    - Added a patch to enable DNSSEC validation in Qt
                      based applications

<h4>dnssec-check</h4>
<p>Completely rewritten GUI with many new features

                    - Now contains the ability to submit the results
                      to a central DNSSEC-Tools repository.  The
                      results will be analyzed and published on a
                      regular basis.  Please help us get started by
                      running dnssec-check on your networks!  Note
                      that it explains that it only sends hashed IP
                      addresses to our servers and the reports
                      generated will be aggregation summaries of the
                      data collected.
                    - It now runs on both Android and Harmattan (N9) devices

<h4>maketestzone</h4>
<p>Now produces zones with wildcards and changes to

                      NSEC  record signatures

<h4>dnssec-nodes</h4>
<p>parses unbound log files

                    - Initial work porting to Android

<h4>dnssec-system</h4>
<p>tray

                    - parses unbound log files

<h2>1.11</h2>
<h3>New Features:</h3>

<h4>libval:</h4>
<p>Significant improvements and bug fixes to the 

                      asynchronous support.
                    - Added asynchronous version of val_getaddr_info.
                    - Some reworking of the asynchronous API and callbacks.
                      Note the asynchronous api is still under development and
                      subject to changes that break backwards compatibility.

<h4>rollerd:</h4>
<p>Added an experimental time-based method for queuing

                      rollover operations.  This original method (full list
                      of all zones) is the default queuing method, but the
                      new method can be used by editing the rollerd script.
                      rollctl and rollrec.pm were also modified to support
                      this change.
                    - Added support for merging a set of rollrec files.
                      rollctl and rollrec.pm were also modified to support
                      this change.

<h4>dnssec-nodes</h4>
<p>This graphical DNS debugging utility was greatly enhanced

                    - Now parses both bind and libval log files
                    - Multiple log files can be watched
                    - Node's represent multiple data sets
                      internally, which are independently displayed
                      and tracked.
                    - Added support for searching for and
                      highlighting DNS data and DNSSEC status
                      results

<h4>dnssec-system</h4>
<p>tray

                    - This utility can now report on BOGUS responses
                      detected in both libval and bind log files.
                    - Summary window revamped to group similar
                      messages together.

 Plus many more minor features and bug fixes

<h2>1.10</h2>
<h3>New Features:</h3>
    - New Apps:     (see the validator/apps directory for details)
                    - dnssec-check: check dnssec support from your ISP
                    - dnssec-nodes: graphically displays a DNS
                      hierarchy, color coded by each node's DNSSEC status
                    - dnssec-system-tray: displays pop-up
                      notifications when a libval-enabled application
                      triggers a DNSSEC error
                    - lookup: a graphical DNS lookup utility that
                      displays the results in a hierarchical tree and
                      color codes the window according to DNSSEC status
<h4>libval:</h4>
<p>Added support for building on Windows.

      & libsres     - added support for falling back to recursion when
                      the caching name server does not appear to 
                      support DNSSEC. This also works as a mechanism
                      to work around a poisoned or misbehaving cache. 
                    - Significant improvements to the asynchronous support. 
<h4>lsdnssec:</h4>
<p>Improvements to lsdnssec to display different

                      output depending on whether a zone is a
                      stand-alone zone or under control of rollerd.
<h4>nagios:</h4>
<p>Plugins for the nagios monitoring system which

                      enable monitoring of zone rollover states.
<h4>firefox:</h4>
<p>Updated patches that work with the most recent firefox


 Plus many more minor features and bug fixes

<h2>1.9</h2>
<h3>New Features:</h3>
<h4>lsdnssec:</h4>
<p>Added a new flag (-p) to show only zones in a

                      particular rollerd phase.
                    - fixed bugs to align timing output with rollerd.
<h4>rollerd:</h4>
<p>Added a -logtz flag for logging timezones

                    - fixed bugs related to the -alwayssign flag.
                    - zonesigner's path is taken from the config file.
<h4>rollctl:</h4>
<p>Added -rollall and -rollzone options.

<h4>zonesigner:</h4>
<p>Assumes keys need to be generated for new zones

                      (Assumes -genkeys option was given if a keyrec file
                      can't be found.)
                    - Exits with unique exit codes if a failure occurs.
                      ("zonesigner -xc CODE" can lookup a description for it.")
                    - Added the -phase option so rollover options could be
                      more easily specified.
<h4>lights:</h4>
<p>A simple GUI to check the status of rollover states

<h4>blinkenlights:</h4>
<p>Added hide/show commands for rollrec names and zone

                      names, for split-zone support
<h4>cleankrf:	</h4>
<p>Fixed deletion of obsolete set keyrecs.

    - GUI commands: - Fixed how the Exit command works so they don't coredump.
    - libsres
      & libval:     - New beta support for issuing asynchronous requests.
                      This can speed up queries by up to 4 times if used.
                      (see example code in validator/apps/validator_selftest.c)
                    - NSEC3, DLV and IPv6 are enabled by default.
                    - improved logging and logging-callback support.
<h4>drawvalmap</h4>
<p>Can output PNG files now


<h3>Packaging:</h3>
                    - Our download page now allows you to download
                      the C validator libraries independently of the
                      full DNNSEC-Tools tool-suite.

<h3>Many bugs were also fixed in the 240+ changes.</h3>

<h2>1.8</h2>
<h3>New Features:</h3>
    - zonesigner, rollerd
                    - Made changes so that these tools are more compatible 
                      with recent versions of Bind
                    - The zone_errors configuration parameter allows a zone-
                      specific maximum to be set.  Once exceeded, that zone
                      will be skipped rather than allowing rollover to continue.
    - blinkenlights
                    - Recognizes when rollerd abruptly quits, so error messages
                      aren't spewed interminably.
<h4>ZonFile::Fast</h4>
<p>Fixed parsing of DS records containing spaces and 

                      parsing of mname and rname SOA fields
                    - Added support for parsing KEY records
<h4>keyrec.pm</h4>
<p>Made changes to properly lock keyrec files before 

                      writing to them.
                    - Begun process of deprecating keyrec_open().
<h4>mapper:</h4>
<p>added a new option: --node-size for mapping

                      complex zones.
<h4>dnspktflow:</h4>
<p>added two new options:

                      --layout-style for selecting the layout style to use
                      --node-size for mapping complex zones.
                    - Add new (default) option to cluster
                      authoritative nodes together to help better
                      understand the relationships between traffic
                      patterns and authoritative name server/zone arrangement.
<h4>libval:</h4>
<p>Now distributed with the Root TA.

                    - Added stricter checks for openssl SHA-256 support in 
                      configure. 
                    - Added several improvements that allow the validator to 
                      lookup information within provably insecure zones that 
                      do not handle EDNS0 requests nicely. This includes 
                      adding support for turning off EDNS0 when traversing a 
                      name hierarchy that leads to a provably insecure zone, 
                      EDNS0 fallback support, and additional checks to check 
                      the sanity of response data.
                    - Fixed certain bugs in CNAME handling and in the 
                      validation of proofs accompanying wildcard responses, 
                      referrals and alias chains.
                    - Fixed support for RSADSA and RSASHA-512 signature 
                      validation.
    - Mac OSX:      - Added a Ports file for mac ports
                    - updated the fink build spec

                      referral conditions. 
                    - Fixed an issue in the where it was not correctly 
                      down-casing the names prior to validating DNSSEC
                      signatures. 
<h4>trustman:</h4>
<p>Fixed trustman's operation when revoking and

                       draft 
                     - Added initial RFC 5155 NSEC3 support 
                       (configure --with-nsec3)
                     - Optimized the referral processing and glue fetching 
                       logic so that libval does a better job in trying to 
                       determine the referral zonecut, and so that it is less 
                       aggressive in fetching missing glue. Also allow for glue 
                       to be fetched on demand.

<h2>1.4.1</h2>
<h3>Security Issue:</h3>
   The DNSSEC-Tools libval validating resolver library does suffer
   from the same issues that the other DNS resolvers were faced with
   as described by:    http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113

   Although DNSSEC will prevent the issues, it is assumed that not
   everyone is using libval with only 100% DNSSEC protected zones.

   The supporting tools that do not use libval are not affected by
   this problem (eg, zonesigner, rollerd, donuts, etc are just fine).

<h3>NSEC3 value change</h3>

   Now that the NSEC3 RFC has been published we've changed the
   internal numeric RR code to the assigned value.  The NSEC3 code,
   however, is still considered experimental and not fully tested.

<h2>1.4</h2>

 
<h3>Documentation:</h3>
   - Much more extensive documentation has been written about the
     tools and how to get started using them.  See the following web
     page for details:

     http://www.dnssec-tools.org/wiki/index.php/Tutorials

<h3>Applications:</h3>
   - trustman has seen a lot of usability improvements and now has
     more extensive documentation.
   - rollerd and it's controlling scripts can now handle user
     initiated KSK rollovers.
   - zonesigner handles keys stored in other directories better.
   - donuts output has been made more user friendly and the verbosity
     level can now be more finely tuned.
   - donuts rule definitions have been cleaned up and the API for
     writing rules has been simplified.

<h3>libval</h3>
   - There have been a number of minor API changes in libval
   - Support was added for environment and app name-based policies in libval
   - Initial release of the libval_shim library (LD_PRELOAD-based
     approach for transparently enabling validation for various
     applications)
   - The perl Net::DNS::SEC::Validator binding has been updated to
     accomodate the libval changes.

<h3>Many more minor changes and improvements</h3>

<h2>0.9.1</h2>
  - validator library (dnssec-tools/validator):
    - code has been re-structured within the following 
      sub-directories: 
      libsres/ libval/ doc/ etc/ apps/ and include/
    - configures and builds cleanly on the following systems: 
      Fedora, MacOSX, FreeBSD
      (should configure and build on Solaris -- not actually tested)   
    - includes support for tuning "off" DNSSEC using the
      "zone-security-expectation" policy construct. 
    - APIs modified to comply with (upcoming version of) 
      draft-draft-hayatnagarkar-dnsext-validator-api
 
  - dtinitconf, dtconfchk, dtdefs:
    - these tools are used to create, check and consult the 
      file dnssec-tools.conf which is used by many of the
      dnssec tools. dtconfchk was previously known as confchk.
     
    - modules/defaults.pm was also added to provide defaults
      for the above tools.

  - rollinit, rollctl, rollchk, rollerd, lsroll:
    - these tools are used to create, check, and list the roll
      rec files to be used by rollerd and rollctl.

    - rollerd is a daemon to manage DNSSEC key roll-over.

    - rollctl is used to send commands to a rollerd daemon.

  - TrustMan:
    - manages keys used as trust anchors in named.conf and
      dnsval.conf
    - can be run as a daemon or as a one-time check
    - configuration is placed in dnssec-tools.conf

  - donuts:
    - supports a --show-gui flag to display a graphical
      error browser (requires perl QWizard and Gtk2 modules).
    - A better (optional) GUI interface for new users

  - Most tools should report a --version flag. 

  - Other minor improvements have been made to other tools and
    supporting files.
