<h2>News: 2.0 Released</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<h4>Bloodhound</h4>
<p> <a href="http://www.dnssec-tools.org/download/#gotoBloodhound">A mozilla-based DNSSEC-enabled browser</a> with DANE support
                    - Added support for validation of SSL certificates
                      using the DANE protocol.
<h4>Owl</h4>
<p>The Owl Monitoring System uses timed DNS queries
   to monitor basic network functionality.  The system
   consists of a manager host and a set of sensor hosts.
   The Owl sensors perform periodic DNS queries and
   report to the Owl manager the time taken for each
   query.  Over time, this shows the responsiveness of
   the DNS infrastructure.
<h4>curl</h4>
<p> Added support for validation of SSL certificates
                      using the DANE protocol.

<p> Many new features have been added:
    - The validation tree now supports clicking on
    boxes to highlight it and the arrows that derive
    from it.  Great for use when teaching about

    - An extensive filter/effect editor now lets you
    tailor the look of a graph to color-code, set
    the alpha levels, etc of nodes based on their
    names, status, data types, etc.
    - Right clicking on a node lets you center the
    graph on that node.
    - More data types are collected and shown in the
    data view.
    - Support for arguments on the command line for
    parsing log files, pcap files and domain names.
