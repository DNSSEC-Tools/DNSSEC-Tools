    <h1> The DNSSEC-Tools Project</h1>

    <h2>You are insecure</h1>

    <h3>So you told me, but why?</h3>

    <p>Because the bumper image actually is loaded from a domain name
    which is insecure.  It actually has dnssec data for the A record
    for the web server, but the A record actually contains a bad
    signature.  A browser that was properly protected, either within
    the browser itself or because your site's recursive validating
    resolver was secured, it would prevent you from retrieving this
    image since the zone date for the web server was known to be bad.
    For a list of our test records, see our <a
    href="http://www.dnssec-tools.org/testzone/">Test Zone</a> page.

    <h3>What would it look like if I was secure?</h3>
      <p>Here's a screen shot from a secured version of firefox
      looking at the same page:</p>
      <div align="center">
      <img border=4 src="images/firefox-secured.png" />
      </div>
      <p>Additionally, the firefox extension bundled with dnssec-tools
      1.2 will provide the ability to see how many DNS lookups were
      done for a given page, and which ones were validated, simply trusted,
      and which were broken:</p>
